1,81, In 1992 we bought a new Taurus and we really loved it  So in 1999 we decided to try a new Taurus  I did not care for the style of the newer version  but bought it anyway I do not like the new car half as much as i liked our other one  Thee dash is much to deep and takes up a lot of room  I do not find the seats as comfortable and the way the sides stick out further than the strip that should protect your card from denting It drives nice and has good pick up  But you can not see the hood at all from the driver seat and judging and parking is difficult  It has a very small gas tank I would not buy a Taurus if I had it to do over  I would rather have my 1992 back  I don t think the style is as nice as the the 1992  and it was a mistake to change the style  In less than a month we had a dead battery and a flat tire br br  
2,90, Now I m no granola munchin  hippie but this beast of a car is a hazard to the environment and everyone else on the road  While it may be roomy  can easily fit 9 people  this means that the SUV must weigh 9 tons  The vehicle is over 7 feet tall and wider than most parking spaces  All of this excess means one thing  if you are involved in a accident with one of these you will probably be killed   It s like going up against a monster truck  Don t let Ford fool you either  these cars  SUV s in general  do not have any emissions standards so basically these things pollute as much a big rig  With the surge in the popularity of these things that means that the earth is becoming polluted at an even more alarming rate  So maybe the environment or the hazards to everyone else don t phase you  You have your mind set on one of these babies  Just check out the price and the gas mileage these things get  If you live in CT like me then the price of gas alone equals the price of the car in a few years if you drive at least 40 miles a day  All of these things means that this excess room is just costing everyone else including the owner  If it s room you want then get an RV or a van  Just not a stupid  ugly SUV br br  
3,60,  The 1992 Ford Taurus  was now in its 2nd generation  many car companies for 1992 had revised their sedans to look more aerodynamic  so Ford had to do something to stay on top in the style department  Unfortunately this attempt resulted in a more blase look  The 1992 Ford Taurus  while improved in some areas  never made it past 1st base in other areas   The 1992 Ford Taurus  is not much different than the 1991 models  the 2 4 liter  90 horse powered engine is finally dropped  but there still is an anemic 140 horsepower 3 0 Vulcan V6 as its base engine  The 1992 also weighs more than its predecessor  tipping the scales for the first time over 3 100lbs  The next engine is the Essex 3 8 engine  It too has 140 horsepower  but unlike the Vulcan 3 0 it gets all its power at a much lower RPM  and has more torque  215lb ft  The top of the line engine is the 3 0 DOHC engine that was built partly by Ford  and mostly by Yamaha in Japan  This engine cranks out an impressive 220 horsepower  and will burn rubber if you don t watch your right foot at a stop light  This engine unfortunately is only available in the top of the line  SHO  models  and they only come with a 5 speed manual for this year  The AXOD transmission still  after thousands of complaints  comes in the GL and LX models with the OHV 3 0 and 3 8 engine  Ford obviously did not listen to their customers very well i Driving Impressions i   T he LX equipped with the 3 0 is what most of the critics called  anemic   boring  and just  plain sad  this lack of power problem was obviously an issue that I did not share alone  This car not only was slow in the lightweight models of the mid 1980s  but for 1992 it s even slower with the added weight and no increase in engine power  The 1992 Ford Taurus  of course is not a race car  however shouldn t  acceleration  onto the freeway at a decent pace be a standard amenity in an almost  20 000 family car  I think so  Remember  when these cars were new they were not exactly cheap  some LX models were as much as  21 000  a good engine  with adequate power is not asking too much  is it  My Test car  a 1992 LX only had 82 000 miles on it  but felt like it had much more  There were tears in the headliner and vanity mirrors  the carpet was worn  the back seat had tears in the cheap leather  This car looked as though it had been through the war  There was even a time while accelerating up hill that the transmission totally slipped out of gear  I had to shift to neutral then back to D  After letting off of the gas pedal  the transmission let itself go back into high gear  and I resumed my way up the hill at around 45 MPH on the freeway  very dangerous when the speed limit is 80  but I had no choice i Interior Accommodation i  The  interior  is not too bad  I ve never personally been in a 92 Taurus when it was brand new  lets see  in 1992 I was around 14 years old  But I can imagine what this car probably looked like  The leather probably looked plush  the headliner fitted like a nice pair of leather pants  and the transmission as silky smooth as my skin  that s me trying to be funny  Anyway enough about probably s  this car is now 10 years old and it is pretty darn close to what many would consider junk  The interior does boast tons of room  trunk room included  There is 6 way power seats with lumbar support as an option for the LX  leather  a cold AC  an optional electronic dash  electric antenna  5 MPH bumpers  front air bags  finally  ABS is an option  The 6 speaker Ford sound system probably would have been good  but it didn t work so I can t comment   Exterior Innovation i  The  exterior  looks much like the 1st generation s  The rear looks a little more square  there is modified tail lights and head lights  body colored bumpers and door handles  more attractive stock rims  and paint has been revised so it doesn t wash off as easy as the previous 1st generation models  When I say  wash off  in a number of cases this actually happened with first generation Ford Taurus i Price i  The  price  for a 1992 LX Taurus will cost you around 3 000 dollars  In many cases these cars are being given away  or close to it   Other Cars To Consider b i 1  Dodge Intreped 2  Eagle Vision 3  Chevrolet Lumina  a href content 63653777028 http www epinions com content 63653777028 a   My Review 4  Honda Accord 5  Toyota Camry 6  Chevrolet Corsica 7  Plymouth Acclaim 8  Dodge Dynasty 9  BMW 3 series 10  Ford Thunderbird  Happy Car Shopping  
4,40, I have a Ford Explorer Sport and I know I am going to get some flack for writing this epinion but I feel I must voice my epinion anyway  I have read many other epinions about the Ford Explorer and many people seem to love this SUV I however would never ever buy another one The vehicle is very attractive looking roomy quite comfortable and not that bad on gas BUT the construction is extremely poor  My doors  quot dropped quot  because the hinges were made so poorly  The inside door panel and handle construction is so poor that my handles actually broke off just from regular use which in turn caused my inside door panels to crack split and then break altogether When I take the vehicle out of 4 wheel drive I am instructed to back up a bit to totally disengage the hubs  What is that  I don t see other people backing up all over the place to do that  This can t be right but if I don t back up I hear crunching and grinding and I don t dare drive it What a poor system  I was told by the service department that this was normal for the Ford Explorer though and that I need to backup My ABS system doesn t work properly either and I have had times when I wasn t sure I was going to be able to stop for school buses and such  I found this to be a very scary experience Now I get a recall card in the mail saying the rear door  hatch  hinges are poorly constructed and could be dangerous  NO KIDDING I have 4 years left to pay on the piece of junk and wish I had never bought it  If I could get out from underneath it I would in a heartbeat I would not recommend the purchase of and Explorer to anyone and would never consider buying one again I have dubbed mine the Ford Exploder I consider it one of the worst vehicles I have ever owned br br  
5,54, In August of 1997 I  Russell  turned the age of 16  My parents told me I could have any car that was available to my choices on the lot  no special oredering my dad said  So as a 16 year old getting his first car  a new one at that  I was very estatic to look at my options  I knew that I either wanted a mustang or an explorer  Well my decision was made  The explorer was mine  After about 3 months of having my SUV  my check engine light decided to come on  As soon as that happend no more than 2 hours later i took it to the dealership and it took them 2 weeks to fix it  It needed a tune up already  Well in mid March my Mach 460 radio system  factory  blew  The dealership did not want to fix this saying that it was my fault  And needless to say my sunroof stopped working  my leather seats started to tear  and keep in mind  I kept very good care of this car  VERY GOOD  she was my baby  I do not think i liked anything about this car after having it for a year and a half  Driving this car was an unbelievalbe experience  Everybody where I live wanted to drive it  It was easy on the handling  very aggresive  and super fast  If you think that this was just a lemon then buy one  on my opinion i have 3 other friends that just have gotten new ones in the past year and they have done the same  I would not recomend this vehicle to my worst enemy  Now however Ford has come out with the Ford Explorer Sport Trac  this car is better by far  I have had mine for about 3 months now and she has gave me NO problems at all  I recommend the Ford Explorer Sport Trac  NOT the Ford Explorer Sport br br  
6,54, I bought my 93 Ford Probe GT used in 1998 from a Jeep dealer  STUPID  I test drove the car and liked it because of the way it looked   it was sporty and fun to drive  It only had 48 000 miles on it  with a purchase price of  9 995  which I now know was about  9 900 too much  When we bought the car  there was a couple of cosmetic things that needed fixed  i e  passenger side door panel falling off  etc  These were fixed within a few weeks  About 6 months into our ownership  some other not so cosmetic problems started happening   brakes grinding loudly  muffler not muffling  normal wear and tear  but things that should have been checked before the dealership sold the car  We took the car in and 2 days later  these simple things were fixed In October of 1999  approx  18 months after purchase  came the motherlode  The Probe overheated one morning when I got to work  I shut the car off and fluids started draining from what seemed like everywhere under the hood  The dealer I bought the car from came to my location and picked up the car  After they looked at it  they assessed that the water pump had gone out  the oil pan gasket was leaking and it basically needed a valve job  Thank GOD for extended warranty  I was without my car for approximately 1 1 2 weeks  Total cost for that job was around  1500  Then when I got the car back  the  quot Check Engine quot  light was on  I called the dealership back and asked why the light was now coming on  when it was not before  They looked at the car again  and found  they thought  that the Mass Airflow Sensor was bad  226  They replaced it  but it did not fix the problem  Then they thought the O2 sensor was bad  another  200 some    replaced it  to no avail  Finally they told me after another week  that they thought the EGR valve had gone bad  but that it would not be covered under warranty  310 for the part alone  I explained to them that even though they considered this a  quot wear and tear quot  part  I should not have to pay for it  We went back and forth  I took the car back and drove it  engine light flashing in my face and all  until I contacted the Better Business Bureau and a local television station  The dealership finally agreed to do the replacement I scheduled my appointment and took the car in  It took them about 3 days to get the part  When they replaced the EGR valve  guess what    it did not fix the problem  Surprise  surprise  So  they cleaned some vacuum lines  etc  still could not find the problem After about a week in the shop  they decided to send it to the Ford dealer down the street and let them look at it  Two and a half weeks later  I get my car back  but only after they put the car on their computer  it told them a part to replace  they replaced it and it didn t fix the problem  Ultimately  I think  it turned out to be a problem with a vacuum pump  or something Now  8 months later  yet another seemingly  quot impossible to figure out quot  problem has surfaced  On July 1  2000  my car quit running  unexplainably  Three different repair shops have looked over the car  trying to determine if it is an electrical problem  which I now understand these cars are notorious for having  or a fuel problem  No one can seem to figure it out  So now  I m back to the Ford dealer on Monday   I wonder if they can pinpoint the problem  I don t have a whole lot of faith I would not recommend this vehicle to anyone  unless you have money to just throw away  and a backup car to drive about every 6 months  for about a month at a time  and if you are just looking for a headache br br  
7,56, So I had to drive a rental car for close to a month and I had two choices  The first was a Ford minivan which I simply would not drive under any circumstance  The second choice was a Ford Contour  and I have to tell you  it was the worst car i ever sat behind the wheel in  First off the Ford contour has all the visual appeal of Grandma s car in my humble opinion  I suppose not a whole lot more can be expected from Ford  Yes if you haven t noticed I am a touch biased  But with that said  I can honestly say I have not liked the look of one single Ford car since the early 90 s  and the Contour is no exception  The Interior is some what comfortable  but the look is very drab  There is no excitement to be found here  An awkward factory stereo consumes most of the center console and the rest is used up by oversized dials for the heater and air conditioning  One of my biggest problems with this car was the fact you couldn t turn the air conditioning on with the defroster on  Now for those who don t live in cold weather  the air conditioner will take the moisture out of the air and defog your windows  Very poor design  To top all the poor layout of the interior  everything was just cheap cheap plastic  Nothing fit snuggly so the whole cab of the car had rattles  Even at less then a year old and almost no miles this car was in poor condition  I hated driving it  Now that I have pointed out some of the flaws of the interior of the car I will tell you how it drove  It drove like a SUV  Not only did it have a horribly stiff suspension when you hit bumps in the road  but the car leaned like a SUV when you went around corners  You would feel like you were about to roll the car taking a corner any faster then 25  It s acceleration was less then stellar as well  Even with a V6 in the car you felt like it would take forever to get up to speed  The throttle response was horribly slow as well  If you needed to get some speed to make a pass you better plan ahead about three seconds  Not only did the car take forever to get to speed  it took just as long to stop  Perhaps part of this problem is due to the incredibly cheap Firestones the car comes with  I ended up having the ABS kick in no less then three times doing pretty standard stops  When the ABS didn t kick in  the car still took forever to stop due to its heavy weight  This car needs to go on a serious diet  Now the gas economy of this car was just as bad as everything else  With my 80 mile commute every day I usually had to stop every other day and get twenty dollars in gas  When I picked the car up from the rental company it had a quarter of a tank  before I even got home I had a gass light flashing at me  Another improvement that needs to be addressed are the headlights  The high beams were average  but the low beams were nonexistant  If you drive at 35 mph at night with the low beams on  you are overdriving them  This car doesn t make a good commute car  it doesn t make a good FUN car  its not built well enough to be a family car  I can t honestly think of anything good about this car  It would be a nice treat if ford stopped designing plain cars that are cheap to mass produce and design something that is better built  better to drive  more practical  and not so plain  Agree or disagree with me if you like  but this car goes into my books as a total blunder br br  
8,47, I should start out by letting you know that I do not know much about cars  But after leasing this vehicle from Ford  I am ready to go back to the horse and buggy  The car has been in the shop more than it has been in my garage  We have leased it for 2 years and it has already had 2 recalls  It is extremely limited in space and anyone with small children will regret the day they purchase this lemon Ford has discontinued the model for the 2001 sales year and for good reasons  Although you cannot purchase this vehicle brand new  I would also discourage someone from buying it secondhand  To top it off  the service department at the Ford is horrendous  They lack professionalism  product knowledge and simple manners  I have to spend a lot time at the garage because of this horrible car and I am not sure if I will purchase another Ford again  The ride in the contour is rough and loud  On a major expressway it feels like you are riding on Space Mountain  The air conditioner is weak at best and the trunk can barely fit a stroller  I guess I should commend Ford for discontinuing this model br br  
9,49, My 2000 Ranger is my first Ford product in 12 years  My initial reaction to this vehicle  The quality of their products has remained the same or dropped in that time period vs  the expected improvement As a truck  my expectations were somewhat different vs  a passenger car  particularly in areas of ride and cab comfort  Generally  I was pleasantly surprised in both areas  However  the overall quality level of the truck quickly eroded any positive feelings for the vehicle Some of the quality problems were superficial or cosmetic   incorrectly cut carpeting  exposed wiring  radio knobs that have no start stop points  Not show stoppers  but enough to leave you uneasy about things you don t see or use on a regular basis Other quality issues were more problematic  The truck was delivered with loose front wheel bearings and was badly out of alignment   to the point of ruining the front tires within 800 miles due to cupping I have experienced  severe vibration in power steering assembly that it intermittent irregular idle and loss of power when clutch is disengaged air conditioning that fails to discharge evaporated water correctly  causing mildew in the evaporator box that must be flushed and deodorized on a regular basis  These are problems that I would expect to encounter at 80 000 miles  not at 800 miles As a daily driver  the truck is a mixed bag  Gas mileage has been disappointing   18 in town  20 on highway vs 22 27 rating  The ride is better than expected   somewhat choppy  but acceptable for a truck  especially with a short wheelbase On the positive side  the standard bench seats are comfortable and come with a 60 40 split  Legroom and headroom is adequate for a 6 0 person  The standard stereo system has a built in cd player and delivers better than average sound quality  The heater delivers more than adequate heat  but does suffer from A C odor problems  Dash board control and gauges are easy to read and provide more than standard idiot lights  A tach would be helpful with standard transmission models  especially to monitor idle levels This truck initially caught my eye due to its sticker price  which seemed very reasonable  Unfortunately  low price does not always mean value  and in this case  it didn t br br  
10,52, I bought my 2001 Cobra in January 2003  I missed the power after selling my modified 1991 Mustang GT a couple of years ago  My Cobra had 13 000 miles on it  so  it was practically new  I was impressed with the power of the Cobra and the brakes  However  I had problems with my Cobra  There was what some call  driveline slop  when shifting  There would always be a loud clunking noise coming from the rear of the car  Eventually  there was a big  bang  one day and it turns out my rear differential failed  There were problems with the warranty repair but that s another story  See note at end  After getting the car back it drove better   Driveline slop  was gone  I was happy until a month later  when the rear axle bearings went out and needed to be towed back home  The car has left me stranded twice and it only now has 27 000 miles on it  The axle was repaired under warranty and now I will sell the car as soon as possible  I will not keep this car past the warranty period There are other things I should mention like the drivers s seat shifting during some cornering and the front bumper is loose  You can move it up and down with your hands  The Ford dealership says this is  normal  I don t think so The overall quality of the interior is kind of cheap looking with lot s of plastic  The shifter console is loose around the shifter  Just overall low quality  Looks like Ford just built a piece of crap car around a good engine and brakes  Note to anyone considering buying a used car from a Ford dealership  If the car is still under mfgr s warranty  have the dealership print you out a copy of the vehicle s  OASIS  report  That s the Ford vehicle info database  It shows all repairs done at Ford dealerships and it shows the vehicles warranty status  This could become important later  
11,33, We have bought this car in Feb  2001 and kept for 9 months Because the car was really cheap  the car has been working satisfactorily  But the car requires maintenance every months causing minor problems here and there The car has 91 000 miles and we had to fix so far as follows the cost of labor includes  starter 227  front end   alternator 241  a hole in radiator 86    new radiator 125  a c not fixed yet    door lining tipping don t bother fixing them  This car has been teaching us how to maintain the car because it breaks down very often  
12,43, I don t own a Ford Contour  but I rented one for my class reunion in GA last weekend  I had the car for only 4 days  but I noticed immediately many of the ups and downs of this automobile I currently own 2 cars that have amazing stereo systems in them  One has an incredible 7 speaker Nakamichi stereo  see my Lexus LS400 review also  The Ford Contour had a very basic 4 speakers system that took some getting use to  The most obvious problem was the deck wattage output  With the volume all the way up  sound quality was poor and distortion from any amount of bass was unacceptable  I ve heard some of the Mach systems in other Fords  so I know quality is in reach if a potential buyer needs something better In Georgia it is humid almost year round  so a top notch ventilation system is a must  The Contour has that down pat  The AC worked very well with simple knobs and switches for easy operation and it blew VERY COLD just how I like it  Acceleration was a disappointment also  Flooring the gas pedal resulted in a lot more noise than movement  which was quite a let down for a modern day V6  Handling was a pleasant surprise  especially cornering  Taking a quick turn wasn t at all a frightening experience like in some cars this size  but the rattles from the interior made me wonder if something might fall off the next time The classification of this car has a lot of competition  The Nissan Altima  Toyota Corolla  Mitsubishi Galant  and Saturn make it a crowded field in the similar price range  I ve driven the all new Nissan Sentra and I think it s a hidden treasure in itself The Ford Contour is an acceptable vehicle for the die hard Ford fan that will never consider another brand  but the competition is stiff and many better cars are out there for the taking at a comparable price br br  
13,59, I currently own an Aspire and there are some good things about it and some bad things about it  One of the great things about this car is the mileage  I can fill it up and it will go forever  However this car really does not handle well  One gust of wind  and I am blown all over the road  I recently had a blow out going about 55 mph on the highway  The driving conditions were ideal  but I my car was thrown into the side railing of a bridge and the damage accrued from this simple blow out is going to be about  2000 dollars  This estimate is the average from 3 body shops  When the blow out of my tire occurred I really did not realize how much damage the little bang had done until I tried to change the damaged tire  These cars are not made well  I would not call them safe cars because of the amount of damage I sustained from such a seemingly simple fender bender     
14,60, I recently got to test drive a 2001 Ford Mustang with my friend who is going to buy it  The particular car we drove was a V6 manual transmission convertible  I ll say it right now   the car looks really cool  I felt like a millionaire driving it  Bright yellow with a black convertible top  and a black leather interior  It s definitely a fun car  but only on the outside On the inside  you re treated to horribly uncomfortable font bucket seats  and an even worse rear seat  Even though everything was covered in soft leather  the seats were hard and unforgiving  I can stay put in my 1991 CRX for 6 hours without a single problem  but my back hurt after half an hour of driving this beast  Not only that  but the legroom was awful  I can completely stretch my legs out in my CRX  I m 6 1  but in the Mustang my knees hit the dash with the seat scooted all the way back  What gives  I realise it s a sports car  but how hard would it have been to give you a couple extra inches of legroom  I won t even talk about the rear seat  it s more of a storage space for your stuff that won t fit in the tiny trunk than a place for people to sit Next up  performance  For a car that looks so pretty  you d expect it to have the innards to back up it s racey look  Not so my friend  I actually street raced someone  I know  not smart  who was driving a Miata  I could see they had a five speed too  but here s the thing  Miatas are rated at I believe 135hp   they re also a 4 cylinder  while the V6 Mustang is rated at 160hp  The Miata won  and I was disappointed by the lack of performance in this beautiful car I was driving  It was like driving my mom s Civic  except extremely uncomfortable  and with poor handling That reminds me  the handling  I m used to my little CRX  which can stop on a dime  and with the right tires make 90 degree turns are 30mph  The Mustang seemed to hesitate when making evasive maneuvers  The car is pretty heavy too  which made it feel more like a truck than a sporty coupe Needless to say  I can not recommend this car  It s too unrefined for my tastes  and lacks the amount of power you d expect from a legend  My friend bought it anyway  and that s great for him  But I ll stick with my CRX  thank you very much  
15,32, I bought this vehicle used in 1995 because I was expecting our first child and the sports car just would not do any longer  This was not my first choice for a sports utility but at the time the price was right  we paid  12 000 00 and it only had 40 000 miles on it  It was driven by an older gentlemen who had kept it in excellent condition and had only used the 4 wheel drive in snow  It has the Eddie Bauer package  power windows and doors  rear window defrost  cruise control  and a tow package  I loved it at first  but then after only a year  I started having problems with it  The check engine light would come on but whenever I stopped it would go off again  It spent 3 weeks in the shop with no problems found  On my way home from the shop  wouldn t you know it  the light came on  only this time it never went off  The shop at our Ford dealer said it was just a sensor gave me the bill for  856 84 and left me there almost in tears  Two weeks later  we started the same process with the rear anti lock brake light  Three years later I am still driving with this light on as no one can figure out how to fix it  To make a long story short  we have  in 6 years  replaced the oil pump 5 times  the brakes I couldn t tell you how many times  and other items relating to the engine so many times that we finally had it rebuilt in 1999 and I am still having problems with it stalling all the time  It now has 152 000 miles on it  I love to drive this type of vehicle when it is running correctly  I can see where I am going  even in the pouring rain  I live out in the boondocks so I really need this type of vehicle to get in my driveway at times  I would recommend a sport utility in a heartbeat  just not this particular one  It has cost me almost twice what I paid for it in mechanical bills  There are parts on this vehicle oil pump  battery  water pump  fuel pump  that you can count on breaking within a certain number of miles  So whenever it gets close to the mileage on these parts  I just stay close to home  The wrecker service in this area is on speed dial on my cell phone br br  
16,43, I remember the day my parent s came driving into the drive way with this piece of work  Granted I didn t own a car at this point  but something told me the Tempo was a bad buy To begin with there was no tape player  while this was only a small problem the fact that the speakers were rather cheap and would blow if I attempted to play a song at a loud decibel The basic scheme of the Ford Tempo  in my mind  was to build a cheap car that resembled something sporty  However  along the way they seemed to forget that people have a way of remembering if a car breaks a lot To begin with the electronics that kept track of the fuel  shorted out after about two months  when my parents went to return the car so it could be fixed they were told it would cost in excess of  500 I had heard from a friend of mine that the car was pretty much just a piece of trash that breaks every 15 seconds  but I could not believe this  How could the makers of the Mustang and Thunderbird possibly make a lemon I had decided that the gas gauge was merely bad luck and one of those unexplainable things  but a short while later when the alternator went I began thinking differently  For the record we replaced the alternator three times  and eventually just gave up on the car and bought something else My friend bought a 1988 Escort about a year ago and the transmission and seat belt motors went  and presently my friend Josh has a 1995 Escort that makes strange noises that are suspicious  Perhaps  it s time for Ford to stop trying to bring out new models like the Focus and work on the lesser ones like the Tempo I d give Ford a B  or A  for the Mustang  Thunderbird  and Probe  but a C overall because of the Tempo br br  
17,41, Right now I drive a 1999 Ranger 4X4 x cab 4dr 4 0L  but I d like to go back to my first in 1986 when I as 19  NEW Ranger  1My dad co signed for my first new truck  I bought a 86  Ranger standard cab 4X4 STX with one of the first push button 4X4 systems  I thought that was  way cool  back then  As far as longevity goes for this one I can t say but I know it could take a lot  Being a stupid 19yr old kid and adding a 100 000 mi bumper to bumper that I was told would cover any thing I drove it as if I was Mickey Thompson  I lived to get all fours off the ground and being a 19yr old party animal in a rural community I found opportunity practically daily  I was 4by n with a friend in this truck and making those tv commercials appear tame and in the mist of roaring laughter and fast paced action my friend turns to me and says  quot next time around let me out quot  I reply  quot you scared quot  and he says  quot no I ve only seen this on tv quot  and this was daily with this truck  being reckless I totaled it with 12 000 mi on it and it NEVER SAW A SHOP ONCE  That s damn good when you consider those off road racers rebuild those truck after each race  To give you the sense of reckless abandon that 19 yr old drove his truck with remember in  quot Ferris Bueller s Day Off quot  the parking attendants faces in the Ferrai as it was flying through the air  That was the elation I experienced for 12 000 miles  My relationship with that truck is like looking back on old girlfriends from my youth  The times I had and the memories I would never want removed but I could never have that type of a relationship with a vehicle again and have never had all four off the ground with any other vehicle in my life since  By the way  to this day I still remember the salesman saying  quot You ll be a Ford man for life quot  so far he s been right So now I go through a few used vehicle wondering if buying new is worth it NEW Ranger  21991 just broke up with a girl and replace her with a truck  A little    
18,30, I have always hated Fords except for the Explorer which is an amazing car  but I absolutely hate the Taurus so much  It is a waste of room on the Highway  and it baffles me why people buy this car  it always falling apart like a typical Ford sedan does  Who in the right mind would buy this piece of JUNK No I really hate this car  it has no positive feature to it  and to top it off  it is one of the number one selling cars in the country  believe it or not  I dont believe it but it s actually true  I HATE FORDS  i hate them so much  They are terrible cars  dont buy them br br  
19,31, My wife and I recently acquired a used 1996 Ford Contour  We were looking for something else but the car dealer convinced us this was  quot the car for us quot  This car has given us nothing but trouble  It has been recalled twice  The speakers are the current problem  The right speakers will periodically stop working  In addition to that the bass has never been really good but I do like to have a system that can at least vibrate the car a little  The bass levels at their highest setting will give most rap songs a little beat but not a boost or a bang  We have also had problems with the air conditioner and the brakes within less than a year from when we bought it  It also does not get good gas mileage  We have to refill at least once a week  We are looking for a way to affordably get rid of it  In all fairness  I may be a little bias because I use to own an 86 Ford Escort and it gave me a large amount of problems and cost me too much money  After the Escort I have developed a negative opinion towards and Ford compact car but this Contour is proving my opinion right  I was hoping that I was wrong about how bad Ford cars are but the Ford Contour that we bought has proven me more right than ever before  Positive comments  Well it does have excellent pick up or  quot get up and go quot  That may attribute to the bad gas mileage  This car is great for those guys who like to race little old ladies at the red light  It will most definitely beat most small cars  buses  and semi trucks  My opinion of this car and most Ford cars is that they are prone to failure  Don t sneeze near it or kick the tires or else it could fall apart  Maybe Ford s just don t like me     
20,37, The Ford Mustang has really made a great car with there new convertible and witht the hard top  The Car has plenty of power along with a great design that will turn heads everywhere  One of the best parts about the car is that it has a roomy enough seat to have an average sized adult sit back there  especially when the top is down  It is a little cramped  but much better than most other convertibles  It has an electric top which makes it easy to get out in the sun with just a push of a button  The car has plenty of power to get the wheels spinning  and you won t need to bring extra fuel tanks  it does pretty well on gas mileage  One of the down sides to the car  is that it looks as if the outer molding is very much like thinplastic  and woul probably break in an accident  However  it still looks really great  and for kids   or adults that act like kids  it is a great car br br  
21,48, Ford sets up extended warranty program costing ford 200 million dollar in response to class action lawsuit covering faulty engines in 94  95 Windstars  Ford has since extended this program to cover additional models that have 3 8L V6 engine  tauruses  sables  mustangs  2 million Ford vehicles are covered but not 96 Windstars  Ford gives horrible customer support  Replacement engine blocks are in high demand and on back order  It takes Ford 8   11 weeks to replace faulty engines  Center for Autosafety in Wash  D C  is considering further action against Ford on behalf of 96 and later year Windstar owners  Stay away from Windstars  
22,37, I bought my 1995 Ford Probe SE because of the sporty look  the price  and the great things I d heard about Ford cars  My one and only mistake was thinking a car seat would fit in the back WRONG  Well  not totally wrong it WILL fit  but not comfortably  I ve had great luck with my Probe so far  and I DO love it  It s gone over 15 000 miles with no problems  It s only been in the shop 4 times  and only for oil changes and new tires  It gets great gas mileage  which IS good for a family  but like I said there s just not enough room  My Probe has more than adequate power  rides great and is great to look at too   This would be a great car for a single guy or girl  but if a family car is what your looking for pass this one by  The seats aren t the easiest thing to clean   hard to get in the grooves  should Junior spill some ice cream  or drop his lollipop  And with such a sharp look  who wants ice cream and lollipop all over the seats anyway  Though reasonably priced  mine was around  3500  used  you can get a much better deal on a more  quot family quot  type vehicle     
23,51, I bought my 1996 Ford Escort in January 1997 with 9 000 miles on it  I drove it with only minor problems until this last year  Over the course of the last 6 years we regularly maintained it  changing the oil every 3 000 miles  The speedometer broke with around 25 000 miles  but was still under warranty  The AC went out on us in early 2001  The cost to repair it was outrageous  but fortunately a mechanic asked if it was a dirty plug  connection  or something  which it was  so the problem was fixed for around  60 The interior is fairly comfortable  The cloth seats held up well  Rear speakers stopped working after the second year  Instrumentation is easy to read  however  the  check engine  and  check coolant  lights came on at random times and after numerous diagnostic tests at around  70 dollars a pop  we learned that they just like to do that  Leg room is sufficient although we are fairly short people  both under 5 10  My husband always had to drive with a travel pillow behind his lower back on long trips  but I was fine  We definitely wanted to stretch after a few hours  The paint on the rear bumper is faded  Gas mileage was fairly good   we got around 30 mpg on the highway  unless the AC was running and then that sucked it down much faster  If you have children  know that the AC does NOT reach the back  even though it s a smaller car  Our baby was always bright red even with it going full blast  And while the AC is on  you will not be going over any mountains  We turned off the AC then because the car felt like it was straining We replaced the windshield twice  150 each  new tires twice which are NOT a standard size and so are much more expensive  between  55 and  75 each  and a new front and rear engine mount  200 Now as to why I am writing this review  In July 2002  the same month we paid the car off  it stopped in the middle of traffic while my husband was coming to the airport to get us  At 86 000 miles  regularly maintained  the car needs a new motor  The cost to purchase a used motor will run around  3 000  A new motor will cost  5 000  After speaking with several mechanics  Ford dealers  etc  everyone has told us that the cost to repair the car is more than it is worth  Yes  it is  We are now without transportation  with a toddler and one on the way  We did not expect to be in this situation for years based on the reputation of Ford  But we are  No trade in value  no chance to sell it  no car  Everyone says  that s so unusual  they don t normally do that  Well  mine did  I would recommend staying away from Ford Escorts  Replacing a motor at 86 000 miles is ridiculous  We will not be buying a Ford again  
24,43, I purchased our Ford Taurus LX Wagon used with 19K miles and we bought it because I was impressed by it s long list of features and by the way it drove  We had just sold our Ford Aerostar minivan and we were looking for a smaller  more economical family car  What we ended up was a car that just cannot be repaired properly and is not very reliable We have had problems with the interior door panels cracking  the dash bubbling  the power window motors burning out  turn signals that work when they want to  a moon roof that has hardly ever worked  inability to align the front end so we go through a pair of tires every 20K miles  I have only had it serviced by Ford and they have failed to repair most of our problems even after numerous attempts  The Ford dealers no longer believe in test drives  they just look for a problem and charge you even if they cannot find it  I got charged  75 00 to be told that I needed a new  55 00 battery  I also took the car in to have a rubber seal around the door replaced and they charged me  30 00 just to tell me how much it would cost to replace This is my 3rd and last Ford  I had two Ford Explorers and Ford bought both of them back under the California Lemon Law I wanted to love this car  I wanted to forget about my bad experiences with my two previous Explorers but this car is by far worst in every manner I have had it with Ford  Quality is not Job  1  Profit is  Don t even get me started about the fact that Ford knew about the Firestone tire defects for years but still kept putting them on my Explorer and all others  I was the lucky one who is still around to express my displeasure with Ford  The only reason I still have our Taurus because the value has dropped faster than my loan for it  If I sold it today I would lose a few thousand bucks     
25,71, Just last year  GM had an untouched SUV class  that of the Suburban  A class that sold about 150 000 vehicles  one that Ford just couldn t let go unchallenged  The answer  The new Ford Excursion  This hulking SUV is now the biggest in its class  How big  Well  about 4 tons  Its about 3 3 inches wider than the Suburban  and about 7 2 inches longer  Its set on a f250 frame  and from the side looks like a van  but the front end is that of the superduty  It accelerates 0 60 in about 10 6 seconds  which is quick for a 4 ton vehicle  It comes with the Triton V10  the 5 4 V8 or the optional 7 2 liter Powerstroke  Up front it boasts two plush captain s chairs with a center console  The dash and instrument cluster is that of the f250  Further back  there are two rows of seats  which can fold down or be removed to give the Excursion 16 Cubic feet of cargo space over the Suburban  It is 5 4  5 8 inches taller than the Suburban  featuring one of the flattest cargo racks available  The rear hatch opens three ways  to cut down on those huge rear doors  The spare rests inside  neatly packed away against the driver side of the vehicle  After testdriving  I found that the ride was smooth  but firm  The 4X4 suspension is different than that of the 4X2  but being as long as it is  high centering is a problem  Even though this is a fully capable 4X4  off road use is limited again to its size  Added guards under the front bumper keeps cars from sliding under the vehicle in the case of a head on accident  Even weighing 4 tons doesn t keep the Excursion from towing around 10 000 pounds  The V10 sports 310 hp  425lb ft  while the diesel comes with around 500 lb ft of torque  or a 5 4 Triton V8 rated at 255 hp  Safety is great  due to its size  What could hurt the thing besides a bus  It has a massive 44 gallon fuel tank  which takes upward of 60 dollars to fill  But it has a surprising 700  mile range on one fill up  The cool overhead console displays  besides other things  about how many miles you have left in your tank  Price is a big factor  About 34K for the XLT model  40 800 for the limited  Which  for the dollar  isn t a big increase from that of the explorer  or a nice f2 or 350  Roll over is that of any big SUV  Ford has taken great pains to limit roll over as much as possible without sacrificing too much clearance  My personal interaction with this truck is of testdriving br br  
26,52, We bought our used 1994 Econoline E150 Mark III Conversion van in 1998 from friends who didn t need the large van anymore  It had 49 000 miles on it and was in good shape inside  We have thoroughly enjoyed the van for the last two years  You can t beat it for long trips  You don t arrive at your destination feeling beat up  My kids enjoy watching movies or just being able to stretch out in all that space My concerns have only just now begun  Our ABS light on the dashboard started appearing randomly shortly after we purchased the van  When we checked with the Midas place locally about it  they said it was okay to drive  the regular brakes would always be available and they couldn t check it unless the light was actually on  Well it always goes off when the van is turned off and of course never comes on when we are close to a place that can check it  So that has been an ongoing concern  We still don t know what is wrong there Now recently on a trip  of course  the  quot OFF quot  button on the overdrive control started flashing indicating that something was going on with the transmission  Luckily we found an AAMCO place that was willing to take us and check it immediately  They explained that the transmission clutch was starting to slip and reset the button so that it wouldn t be flashing on our trip home  They told us that we could continue to drive it  don t push it by running on cruise control  and sometime the light would come on again  indicating problems again  but when that would be would be anybody s guess  Well of course  to fix it would entail big bucks The bottom line is that we are now babying the van  trying to decide if we want to fix all the problems or buy a new one  Yes we would buy a new one if we could afford it  They are wonderful vehicles and a joy to drive  Once you get used to driving the size  you ll never go back to small cars  The entertainment for the kids on long trips is priceless  No more  are we there yet  or how much longer  I d recommend them to anyone in a second  and I have Just as an update  It is now August 2000 and two things have changed  We did finally get to Midas and have them check out the brake light  They went over it thoroughly  and didn t charge us by the way  and couldn t find anything wrong with the brakes  The manager there told us that this is common in these vans and is probably an electrical short which they couldn t fix  Kudos to Midas Second  the transmission light came on again as we were going on vacation  Finally decided to suck it up and take it to a local nonchain transmission shop owned by an friend  He checked it over thoroughly  again for no charge  and said he wouldn t be driving the thing much longer if it was him  Right now  as we speak  it is in the garage having the transmission replaced  Looks like I ll be driving this one a few more years br br  
27,77, First off  let me state that I do not own this 1995 Ford F150 4wd XLT Supercab Pickup that I am about to review  My best friend owns this truck  I borrowed it from him recently on a 320 mile round trip to pick up an item I bought out of state  Some of you are probably asking yourselves  how can he write up a review on a vehicle that he doesn t even own  Let me add though  that my job provides me the opportunity to drive A LOT of different makes of light duty trucks  1 2 ton  3 4 ton  and 1 tons  These trucks are work trucks  I do not baby them  I use them  With that said  here is my opinion of the 1995 Ford F150 This particular Ford is a teal colored  yuck  short box with 73 000 miles on the odometer  It is fitted with the optional 5 8 liter  351 c u  V8  mated to an automatic overdrive transmission  This engine provided very adequate power  I set the cruise at 75 mph and the truck held it  even going up steep inclines that brought tractor trailers and vw buses to a crawl  The automatic transmission seemed to be very smooth and precise during shifting  With the cruise control set at 75 mph  the tach read a very respectable 2200 rpm  I was very impressed with this since engine life would probably be extended with such a low engine rpm  I have no complaints whatsoever with the engine and tranny in this Ford  I would recommend this engine over the smaller 5 0 liter  302 c u  V8  especially if you plan on pulling a trailer of any size  Also  I checked the mileage on my 320 mile journey  all interstate driving  I got 15 6 mpg  I would say this is par with other makes of 1 2 tons in the 1995 model year  Not as good as our 97 chevy 1 2 ton 4X4  350 c u  I use at work  I can squeeze 20 mpg out of her  This Ford contained two gas tanks to minimize gas station stops  A nice plus I thought the ride quality of this 1 2 ton Ford was quite harsh compared to other makes of 1 2 ton trucks I have driven  I could feel every crack and bump I traversed on the interstate  I could even feel the vibrations through the steering wheel  I couldn t blame the poor ride on bad shocks  since I know my buddy just replaced the shocks  Maybe the poor ride quality could be contributed partially to the type of tires he is running  I don t know  Secondly  I thought there was more road noise entering the cab then was acceptable  Thirdly  I found this truck  quot wanders quot  When this truck would wander into a rut on the interstate  it would pull suddenly to one side than the other  If one wasn t holding onto the steering wheel with both hands it could take you by surprise  I don t know what caused this  tires suspension  This model was equipped with a 60 40 split seat in front  I found the seats to be fairly comfortable  The driver was treated to a power lumbar support  In the center of the seat there was a fold down console  This was very nice  It contained 2 cup holders able to accommodate my rather large coffee mug  The console also had compartments inside for currency  notebooks  cell phones  etc  I am 6 2 quot  and found legroom to be acceptable  Rear passenger legroom is limited though  as is with any extended cab pickup  The small fold down back seat is designed for small children  not adults I did not care for the stock sound system  It was an AM FM stereo cassette w  four speakers  Sound quality was very poor and could not drown out the excessive road noise that this Ford exhibited  The buttons were extremely small making it very easy to hit the wrong button  Also  the stereo was placed in a very awkward position in the dash  I had to reach very far toward the center of dash to turn channels  This could prove to be very hazardous when driving  First thing I would do if this was my vehicle is upgrade the stereo with an after market system  I had the opportunity to use both the air conditioning and the heater on my short 1 2 day trip  gotta love Wyoming  I found both worked fantastic  No complaints in this department This truck was equipped with the power window door package  I found the power windows locks to be very efficient  The windows rolled up and down very fast  I own a 1987 K5 Blazer and my power windows are pathetically slow  So  this was a welcome change In terms of safety features  this truck contained rear anti lock brakes  don t quite understand the reasoning here  and a driver side airbag  A passenger side airbag was non existent  In terms of reliability of this truck  my friend has had darn good luck thus far  Like I mentioned above  the truck now has 73 000 miles on the clock  He has had some problems with keeping the truck aligned  might be linked to the  quot wandering quot  problem  and front wheel bearings going out  I believe that is the only problems he has had in the four years he has owned the truck  I personally like the styling of this 95 F150 better than the new styling of the Ford F150 s  But  if it was my choice I would choose the 95 Chevy 1 2 ton over this Ford     
28,71, I recently had the opportunity to purchase a 1992 Ford Explorer 2 Door as my main vehicle  I have since driven it for 12 000 miles  changed the oil three times  and really have not had any problems with it  The vehicle has a little over 131 000 miles on it  and I am still getting the rated 23 highway   18 city mileage  and sometimes better  but never worse My Explorer is a 5 speed  with is a very dependable piece of equipment  Coupled to the 4 0L V 6  it has enough power to do what I want to do with it  It has the room a college student needs to move in and out every year  and haul people during the year  It is economical enough to be a daily driver  Dependable enough that it really has not seen the shop under my possesion  and small enough that parking it is not compared to parking the more mammoth of SUVs The only time it has seens the shop is when I had to have a synchronizer  1st   2nd shift  replaced  Point of note  dont believe your friend when he says he  thinks  he knows how to drive stick  My Explorer does not have 4wd  but that has not stopped me from taking it offroad  Coupled with my Firestone Wilderness ATX 235s  I have taken mud  sand  and water  within reason  of course The interior on mine is vinyl  but the seats are very comfortable  The front seats are a high backed bucket  which makes long trips easier on your neck I have been pleasantly suprised by my Explorer  and from how it is fairing  I will have it for a good time to come  
29,51, Buying my first car four years ago I searched high and low to find what I thought to be the  quot perfect car quot   for my needs   400  and one lemon later  I realized that I needed to be a bit more circumspect when searching for a used car  I sifted advice from a dozen sources  read books and did a lot of looking around  My decision was to buy a  92 Ford Taurus with 119 000 miles as much as for the excellent offer as for the technical knowledge I d gained about the vehicle  A bit of background first on buying used cars  This is surely not comprehensive  One owner is always a plus  If you can find an older person who is willing to sell  that is also good  More likely than not  they will have religiously taken care of regular and preventative maintenance and will not have beat on the car as young people tend to do no matter the make or model  I might add  they drive it as if it s a sports car  It s also convenient to have access to all repair records  There are stores that will even run the VIN  vehicle identification number  to determine if it has had any factory work performed on it  I ve driven my car for four years now and I have logged over 35 000 miles bringing the total to 156 000 miles  I have driven in rain sleet  snow and hail  I ve driven on new tires  bald tires  performance tires and touring tires  I ve driven cross country and I ve driven locally  My point is  I ve taken this car through every condition possible  hmm haven t made it to the autobahn yet  and I m very familiar with it Over the four years I ve owned my Taurus  I have made substantial repairs  Thus far I ve replaced all four brakes  two front disk and two rear drums  all four struts  the water pump  four tires  one window motor  and two front CV joints These repairs have been costly  but they were necessary for the mileage and their cost was certainly leveraged by the utility I received from the vehicle  Most of the miles I ve logged have been highway miles from commuting  The vehicle  fully loaded with two passengers  would attain a fuel economy of 28 miles per gallon  avg  on long trips  more than 100 miles  For the shorter work home commute it averages 22 25  Around town  the average drops  but that is to be expected from the extremely reliable 3 0 V6  The engine is well known in auto circles as an economic choice that provides power when necessary  I have found it to be a great compromise without moving to a larger V8  The car accelerates well which is not only fun to do occasionally  but necessary when making quick and aggressive driving decisions  Indeed  most reviews will give the 3 0 L a hands down appreciation over its larger counterpart  the 3 8 L  because of its reliability  the latter has often had technical problems The ride of a vehicle or how well it handles inconsistencies in the pavement without disturbing the passenger depends on many factors  Certainly  the road is a factor  but so are tires  inflation and type of struts and shocks  Many cars today have progressive shocks which adjust to the road conditions and change the ride according to speed  Though they weren t standard  I chose to have these put in when I replaced them  With properly inflated tires the vehicle provides an excellent ride even more so at high speeds as compared to a smaller vehicle  The car has power steering brakes locks trunk windows as well as AC and a 4 speaker stereo  These amenities are all standard the GL  While the car has an average wheel base  an average length compared to other vehicles of similar size  the trunk is spacious  I was able to pack modest luggage for four people into my trunk with some room to spare  While I wouldn t recommend towing with the GL  I found it to have the capacity and power to capably transport a full load of people and their luggage One inherent problem with a seemingly large number of pre 1995 Tauruses  enough that this problem had a small write up in a major automotive magazine  seems to be a knocking in the front strut area  This has occurred in my vehicle  and while I don t see any dangerous effects such as uneven tire wear or sloppy steering  this doesn t mean that it couldn t propagate in the future besides  the sound is not only annoying  it causes alarm in my passengers sort of a bump in the night Though my be loved vehicle is aging  and I may soon have to lay it to rest  it was  dollar for mile  one of the best vehicles I ve purchased  and if you as a used car buyer are in the same position I was  I would encourage you to consider the Taurus as a possible vehicle br br  
30,63, We traded in our Ford Explorer on an 1998 Eddie Bauer Expedition and it was the best choice we have made by far  The cabin is roomy  the seats comfortable and easy to clean when the little ones get them dirty and feels like you re riding on air  I do wish we had a more current model  since now the foot pedals on the 2000 models adjust to peoples height  as I am 5 4 quot  I would like that little perk  This SUV turns on a dime  which is great compared to the Crew Cab Ford Pickup we used to own  Much easier to handle in those parking lots at the mall  amp  grocery store  In addition  I didn t know that there was airbag suspension we bought the Expedition  but there is  and it makes it a much more comfortable ride compared to that jolty Explorer  I would recommend this vehicle to a family of three to seven  and the smaller the family  the better for a roadtrip  We just take out the third seat and pile up the back with our stuff  I highly recommend this one br br  
31,50, In 1992 I bought my daughter a new Ford Explorer with a promise from her that I drive it until she started college a year later  When she started to college she took the Explorer with her and I drove another car  She drove the Explorer until 1999 when she purchased a 1999 Ford Mustang  I sold the car I was driving at the time and took back the Explorer  So you can see why I entitled this  quot Recycled Explorer quot We had problems with vibrations from the beginning  which I understand was a problem with most 1992 Explorers  The dealer from which I bought the car tried to correct this problem by installing shims  That didn t work and I ve been told that they should not have done this  This is the only major complaint we ve had with the car  Obviously  it was not so big a deal that we sold the vehicle  It now has 103 000 miles on and still going strong  We have had to replace the anti lock brake system and I recently had the rotors replaced  but the rotors are a part of wear and tear that you would normally expect br br  
32,77, I wanted a Ford Mustang Convertible for years  ever since I got my driver s license  When the 95 model came out  I thought it was the most beautiful car on wheels  that I could afford  of course  It had a powerful V8 engine  gorgeous design lines  leather interior  an automatic top so I wouldn t have to wrestle with folding and unfolding some unwieldy thing  it had a glass window in the back  with defroster  so it wouldn t get scratched like a plastic one  It also had a back seat  so I could pack friends or stuff  It was my dream car  I kept it cherry with weekly detailing In 1999 I totalled my dream car because the combination of the huge  high performance 17 quot  tires  and the powerful V8 engine  although a blast to drive on dry pavement  were a disaster in wet weather  I was going below freeway speeds when I hydroplaned  spun out and hit the center divider twice  The air bags deployed perfectly  and although I had to get out and run from the dead car to avoid being hit by oncoming traffic  I was virtually uninjured  Both the front and the back end of the car were smashed and twisted and virtually gone  But I had no trouble opening the door in a hurry  And not only did the airbags save my life  they prevented injury  I had had the car for four years and it didn t have a scratch  Now it was gone  But I was alive I read later  in Consumer Reports  that many people have had similar experiences with the Mustang big tires big engine in wet weather  But that did not deter me from wanting to get another one  It was still the only car for me But the 99 model is ugly  Its lines are no longer powerful  sleek and lovely  but sharp  angular  overly aggressive and masculine  I ve looked at it and looked at it and the design is just repulsive  It s still a Mustang  it s still a great car  but it cannot compare to the look of my 95  I am dismayed that the designers at Ford are again on the downhill slide with the Mustang  In my opinion  the Mustang of the 70 s and 80 s was one sad looking underdeveloped machine  a far cry from the hot  innovative little pony car of its beginning  I hope that the Mustang of the new millennium will not share that fate  Go back to the drawing board  guys   and make it beautiful again  You can make it powerful and hot looking without making it look like a shark  Start with your 94 96 models  I still haven t bought a new car  and the money s burning a hole in my pocket  and I m itchin to feel again the way that car made me feel br br  
33,64, I bought my  92 Ranger back in Dec of  91 right off the showroom floor  It was just a bit above factory standard  amp  cobalt blue  my fav  color  I was on leave from my Air Force technical training course and was about to be shipped off to Offutt AFB  I needed a truck that could handle a 500 mile trip without breaking this little airman s wallet 04 25 00 Here s some requested information about the engine  2 3 liter  100 h p  4 cylinder As I stated earlier the truck was cobalt blue  here s the rest of the info  XLT  2 wheel drive  5 speed manual transmission  4 cylinder  standard sound system  All said and done it cost me  9500   2 9  financing  over 5 years  I had this truck until 1999  when I upgraded to an F 250  During that time I had only one thing that went wrong  The cellenoid sp  freaked out twice and I had to jump the posts to get the truck to turn over  I also had two factory recalls  Recall 1  A bad seal in the drivers door that might cause the door to open suddenly if water seeped in and froze  Recall 2  A faulty oil pump  I loved this truck  It was small enough that it was able to get 28 MPG on the highway and wasn t a nightmare to park  while still being big enough to haul around things like queen size mattresses with no problem  This truck is a great  quot first truck quot  and is also great for people who need a truck that gets great gas mileage  My one complaint about the Ranger  and Ford trucks in general  is the location of the spare  I had a flat once and I had to drag myself under the truck to get the spare off  it should be a bit easier than that br br  
34,55, When I started  looking  for a new auto I became  focused   no pun intended  on the specification and configuration requirements that were important to me  Now  to tell the truth  I may be a little biased as I generally like Fords and would only consider Subaru as a Japanese auto but  nevertheless  I still made it my mission to be informed about all autos that met my criteria  Out of the  models  that I narrowed it down to   the Subaru Forrester  03  only came with an  unremarkable  power source  the Subaru Impreza WRX kind of suited me but I was a little concerned about the interior room  this was a close one   I still love this car  The upcoming Subaru Baja would not be out for a while and still only had a mediocre engine  Actually  I hadn t even considered a Focus  Why  I wanted to get away from front wheel drive vehicles  I had a  front driver  at the time  my first  and was a little put off by the  quirkiness  of its  handling characteristics  I was about ready to just wait until something came along that suited me   and then something made me decide to give the Focus a try  I drove a  normal  2002 ZX3 and I loved it enough to consider buying it   but before I did I at least made the attempt to locate an SVT model  To make a long story short   I bought one  The handling is great  The looks are cool  subjective  The interior room and features are incredulous  You may find it hard to believe but it does handle better than the WRX  though not as fast  This is what front wheel drive should feel like  Only problem  mine came with a defect   the radiator had a hole or puncture  warranty item  There is no perfect car for everyone  rhetorical  but if I could be  greedy  then I d like to see 4 doors ZX 5  more power and all wheel drive  like the WRX This car is astounding for the price but many may not consider it because they may  group  it as a small car associated with the younger genre  
35,60, We are the proud owners of a 1999 Ford Explorer XLT  We purchased it because we wanted a vehilcle that can handle western New York winters  carry two adults and two older teenage sons  and pull a large  quot pop up quot  camper trailer  At the same time  I didn t want to sacrifice gas mileage as you do with larger suvs  So far  we have been quite pleased with the Explorer  It pulls our trailer  about 2000 lbs  without a problem  with only some loss of gas mileage  When not towing  gas mileage averages around fifteen miles per gallon  or slightly better  Although it doesn t have the soft comfortable ride of our old  89 Crown Victoria  the ride quality is pretty good  With the SOHC V6 engine  there is some noticeable engine and road surface noise   nothing more than you would expect with a truck The vehicle handles very well and is easy to park and maneuver in parking lots  After driving an extended  94 Aerostar mini van  the Explorer seems much smaller and easier to navigate  However  we do miss the third passenger seat and the additional cargo space of the larger Aerostar  But  we have taken several longer trips  300 or more miles  with the Explorer and have managed to have enough room for luggage  cooler chest  Christmas packages  etc  When my wife are using the vehicle around town  we love it for size and convenience There has been one recall so far   replacement of the secondary hood latch which was handled promptly by the dealer  Just last week  we noticed that cold air seems to be coming in through the left rear door speaker  The dealer corrected this by adding insulation to the door  no charge  Overall  the quality craftsmanship of the vehicle is quite good Overall  if you want a SUV that has decent gas mileage and is smaller than the Expedition  Excursion  or Suburban  the Ford Explorer is a good choice  If you need larger towing capacity  or want more cargo capacity  then you will have to sacrifice gas mileage and go with one of the larger vehicles 1 14 2000 Update Well  winter driving has arrived in western NY  and today I found out how well the Explorer handles on slippery  snow packed roads  and I am very pleased with the results  On roads that were somewhat slippery for my Aerostar  the Explorer felt very stable and would not skid or fishtail when I pushed it a bit  So  I ll update this review again when I get a chance to play in some deep snow br br  
36,64, First of all  I live by myself in a dorm in downtown Austin  There is little or no parking available where I live  and most of the places I have to get to are within walking distance  Also  I have a couple of friends that always seem to be willing to drive me around  Because of these reasons  I really have no need for a car I have owned a few  however  Actually  it was mostly partial ownership  as my parents technically bought them and just let me drive around in them  I ve used these cars enough to form an adequate review  I believe  and that is what I intend to do right now The Ford Mustang has always been a great looking car with relatively decent gas mileage  about the same if not better than previous 4 cylinder cars I have used  In particular  I love the  94 model s style when compared to the earlier and newest models  This body style will be a classic  for sure  Passenger wise  it is a great single or two person road trip vehicle  In the three years that I had access to it  it proved itself to be very dependable and still ran great  in spite of having 70 000 miles on it  when we traded it in  I did not consider myself then  nor do I consider myself now a car aficionado by any means  but this was one of my favorites of the cars that I drove  My complaints are minimal  I don t like to drive fast  so the fact that it s 3 8L engine doesn t have the sound or power of other cars didn t affect me much  although my  quot friends quot  made quite a joke out of it  It can still beat most cars off the line with a 5 speed manual  but drops into the backfield rather quickly  Another thing I noticed is that bugs tend to take off too much paint on the hood and front bumper  not to mention the pealing and chipping of the paint right behind the wheel wells  Mud flaps would dramatically fix this problem  The body dents very easily  which can be very costly to repair  The interior is not the quietest place I ve encountered  and the rattling and squeaking noises can be an annoyance  As the car approached the 70 000 mile mark  I began to get a little concerned about the rumors drifting around about head gasket problems on this model  But my fears were unfounded  the inspector didn t even find any minor gasket problems when we turned it in This car was bought for around  10 000 and it is certainly worth the money  as far as I am concerned  It may not be the fastest car on the road  but I loved this car and would recommend it to anyone who asks br br  
37,80, My present car passed away one night on the way to work and my wife and I needed a another car van to replace it  I was always interested in the Aerostar as our friends have them  With 11 year old triplets we needed a van to hold all of us  The seven passenger van was just the ticket for us  We purchased a 91 used in March 2000 and so far no major problems save for having to replace the sliding door track at a cost of  200 00 including labour  My wife and I love the fan The 7 passenger seating is great  it allows us to separate the girls so they won quot t fight on long trips  We highly recommend this van  Anyone with a large family would benefit from this van p s  this van has 230 000 kilometers on it and it still purrs like a kitten has the pickup of a new van br br  
38,72, I purchased my Probe SE  5 speed  used  in 1998 with 53 000 miles  Up until a few weeks ago  she was going strong at 198 790 miles  I drove her hard  fast  and rough  Only had to replace the O2 sensors  Airflow sensor  and tires Great ride  fun road tripping car  and handled very well in all kinds of weather Only drawback was the price on replacement parts  To replace an O2 sensor  retail price from the dealership was  300 each  and both need to be replaced when one goes out   pricy  600 for a set of sensors  Airflow sensor was  300 retail price from dealership as well  This did not include labor  so unless you want to put them in yourself  these are costly The design lacked in handling tire blowout  I had to retire my baby after she was totaled beginning of this month  I had Cooper Cobra tires on the car  when the front driver s side tire split  causing the entire front fender  front quarter panel  side panel  undercarriage panel  and door panel to become squashed as if I d run into a pole  requiring complete replacement if I d decided to pursue restoration  Also the electric wiring shaft was severed  causing the car to lose power while driving 70 mph on a curvy interstate  The entire car would ve had to be re wired  The cost for the panels start at  2000 a piece to replace with upper cost of the door panel to  2700   these are after market value prices  The damage was caused due to a poor design in handling tire split  Granted  sports cars are not meant to handle these situations beautifully  but having made minor design changes could ve prevented some of these damages Overall  I ve never had such a great car run so well with so many miles  I m sure she would ve kept going for another good 40 000 miles easy  All parts  excepting for the sensors mentioned above and the tires  were stock and still going strong I d recommend this vehicle for someone who performs regular maintenance on the Probe and loves to drive long distances  
39,75, Working for the rescue squad in my city  I occasionally get the chance to drive a Ford Crown Victoria  We use them as chase cars  basically  but we call them zone cars  When an ambulance responds to a scene  a paramedic can chase the ambulance or beat the ambulance to the scene using one of these cars  Response time for paramedics is much more efficient this way  It keeps us extremely mobile  First I need to comment on the handling of these cars  There are plenty of other vehicles out there which would have worked just fine for the job we use the vehicles for  but I can see why the city chose to use these above all others  They handle like a dream  They have a very tight grip on the road  and the steering is not lose at all and has little to no play in it  unlike the majority of Ford built vehicles  The seats  in addition to this  are designed deep in an effort to keep you in place while going around curves  All of these factors take a big role when you are traveling at 90mph through rush hour traffic with lights and sirens at full blast  With that said  we are glad they have airbags as well  Next on the list  the power  I m not sure what size engines these cars are normally sold with  it could be the same size we have  or it might not  The ones we use sport a 4 6L V8  I could be wrong though  because they may just very well be sold to the general public the same way they are to us  minus the white paint  reflective stripe down the sides that say rescue  and the red and white strobe light bar on top  Considering the size engine they have in them  I have noticed that they still have excellent gas mileage  It usually ranges from 20 to 21 miles per gallon  This may not seem like much  but just think of how many times we gun the engine with these cars everyday  Also keep in mind that they are usually left running all the time at scenes  For an added bonus  in case most people don t know  strobe lights  sirens  a computer  and several radios draw a lot of power from that hard working alternator  and to make up for it the city sets the engines to run at a high idle  Even after all this abuse they can still conserve a considerable amount of gas  Now for the room in the vehicle  They have a very large amount of space  We can carry everything an ambulance has on board  with the exception of the stretcher  and still have plenty of room for a couple of passengers  Most of the equipment will fit in the trunk  if not all of it if you position it right  Along with tools  a jack  and the spare tire  The space in the front is very good as well  Located up there is a clipboard  many map books  a mounted computer  several radios  the control panel for the lights and sirens  and yes  still room for passengers  I think these cars are very comfortable   I have to drive them constantly around the city for 12 hours at a time  and by the end of the day  other than being tired of working  I still feel just as comfortable as I did when I first got into the car  A direct quote given to me from one of the people that spends much of their duty time in a zone car  The city garage maintains the cars  however we still get the chance to see what repairs have been made  if any  They go into the city garage once a month for preventative maintenance  and for the most part  all we have seen done on these cars is fluid changes  engine cleaning  and adjusting the alignment  balance  rotation  and changing tires  I can say that the tires seem to get worn more often than a lot of other cars  but once again  look how we drive these cars  and besides  a different tire brand could help that  but our city is pretty stubborn  Once in a great while something other than that will have to be repaired  but what car does that not happen on  If you can find one  let me know because I am going to own one soon  Generally speaking  as much as these cars get beat up every day  I am amazed at their ability to stay in great working condition  One owned as a private vehicle would work positive wonders on your maintenance bill  These cars are built very solid  They can absorb much force in a collision  They are designed to do just that  absorb most of the impact and protect the driver  Loaded down with brake and sudden motion activated seat belts  dual airbags  shatterless windows  and a crumbling body  they can be trusted to get you to where you need to be safely  They even have a very sturdy roof  If you re wondering where I became familiar of how well the car protects the driver  they have been rolled  wrapped around poles  had head on collisions  been T boned  rear ended  etc  etc  and drivers walked away from all of it with nothing more than seatbelt sores  airbag abrasions  and a bruised ego  statement based on info gathered from sources in this rescue squad  as well as the local police departments  I have yet to wreck one  and I hope I don t  
40,76, We bought our new 2000 Ford Windstar last October and have been extremely happy with our purchase so far  There have been no mechanical problems at all Here are some of the features that we like best about our Windstar It drives much more like a car than a van  It doesn t have that top heavy  awkward van feeling to it on corners  We were also impressed with the amount of pep the engine has  While it s not a Porsche  it does have very impressive acceleration for a van   much more similar to a car again than to other vans I have driven On the back of the back seat there are these great little hooks that you can use to hook grocery bags onto when you go shopping  This seems like a small feature  but we really love it  You no longer have to worry about the ice cream falling onto it s side and leaking  and you never have to repack your bags with all the items that spilled out during the drive home The idea of removable seats is great  We often take them out when we go camping and put a mattress in the back  It makes for an extremely comfortable sleep  The only thing that would be better would be if they could make the seats lighter  You need to be fairly muscular to take out the single seats  we took the four bucket seats in the first two rows and the bench at the back option  while the bench seat at the back is really a two person job to remove and reinstall Having the sliding doors on both sides is a very helpful feature that allows you to easily access just about anywhere in the vehicle  We used ours to move across the country  and found it very helpful in packing and accessing our belongings once they were packed in We were quite impressed with the stereo system  Before hearing it  we had discussed having a better system installed  but once we had our first listen  we decided we d keep the factory installed model The climate control system is quite good for the people in the front two seats  From a cold start it heats up or provides air conditioning very quickly  however there are no air vents to provide circulation to passengers in the back  A couple of times now when we ve had a full load of people  we have either had to bake or freeze in the front to keep our passengers in the back comfortable  I m not sure if there was an option to have rear climate controls  but if there is it will be something we will think about getting next time  We don t often have many passengers  so it hasn t been too big of a problem for us  but if you frequently carry a full load of passengers  it s something you might really want to think about  I should add that there are two windows at the back that open slightly to help with air circulation  which is great for your passengers when it s hot and you don t want to use air conditioning  The tinted windows that we opted for help with this too Finally  if you like to bring beverages in the car with you  there are more cupholders in the van than you would believe  
41,59, Hot rod trucks are not a new form of radical transportation by any means  however Ford really is on the proverbial  ball  when it comes to this one  Add an intercooled supercharger to Ford s already potent Triton 5 4 liter overhead cam V8 engine  then drop it into a lowered F 150 with a dramatically stiffened suspension and huge disc brakes  and voila  you have the worlds coolest hot rod production truck  not to mention  at the time  the fastest i Driving Impressions i   A ny full sized pickup truck gives you that sense of power   most notably the 2002 Dodge Rams  towering over small passenger cars  In the case of the 1999 F 150 Lightning though  the feeling is enhanced  With 360 horsepower at your right foot coupled to a silky smooth 4 speed automatic transmission don t expect a boring ride  In terms of  acceleration   the 1999 Ford F 150 Lightning is astonishing  ripping 0 60 in under 6 seconds and to 100 mph in an estimated 15 2 seconds  according to many specs  Unlike most trucks where weight and poor aerodynamics come into play at around 80 or so MPH  the Lightning pulls far past that  Add flat  neutral cornering with excellent grip  responsive steering  and very supportive seats  and the mixture is just about perfect for a hot rod show truck   SVT    special vehicles team  selected the 5 4 liter Triton V8 offered in the F 150 and Expedition as the powerplant for the 1999 Lightning  Very good idea if you ask me  The 4 6 found in the Mustangs would have lacked Torque and power if they would have selected that particular engine  The Trition was conceived primarily to deliver a lot of low rev torque  440lb  ft  3 000 RPM  with a smaller bore than stroke of  3 60  x 4 22  Realizing that the Lightning buyers would want substantially more horsepower  some significant changes were made over its predecessor and its lesser models  The main power increase came by way of an intercooled Eaton Series II supercharger  also found the Jaguar XJR  The V8 got a special forged steel crankshaft  sinter forged alloy rods  and special dished alloy 8 4 1 compression pistons  A Larger 2 28  dual bore throttle body was also installed   Suspension b  The basic ladder type separate frame as used on all F 150s is retained for the Lightning  as is the basic suspension  short long arms up front and a leaf sprung live axle out back  Modifications include a lower height  recalibrated springs  modified shocks  thicker anti roll bars  and some massive  four wheel vented disc brakes i Interior Accommodation i  The  interior  of the F 150 Lightning is very much like the regular F 150s  All Lightnings comes with split bench seats with center arm rests and storage bins  The steering wheel is thick and meaty  The stereo system in my test truck was not stock  it was a 6 speaker Alpine system  but from what I hear they came with  excellent sounding  stock sound systems  The gauge s are white  giving you that sporty feel while looking at your speedometer rise   same gauges that are in the SVT Mustang  These gauge s can be found in a number of Ford performance automobiles  There is plenty of room for 3 adults  and the seats are very supportive  and comfortable to boot  Like the regular F 150s for  99 model year  the Lightning is very  car like  in configuration  The drivers position is especially good allowing for easy access to the HVAC controls and all of the gadgetry in the cabin i Exterior Innovation i  The  exterior   while not as bold as the 2002 Dodge Ram or any current generation Dodge Ram  is much more bold than the regular F 150s  There is no confusing a F 150 Lightning with a regular F 150  or any truck on this planet for that matter  The F 150 Lightning comes with side exhaust  a very cool feature  would have been better if it had dual side exhaust  A SVT badge of honor in the rear  Huge 18  rims matched with high performance tires  and an aggressive nose lets other drivers know this is one serious truck  All Ford Lightnings get the practical and convenient opening rear window  Red  black  or white  in all three of the available colors  the F 150 lightning radiates real aggression and style with its lowered stance and sexy five spoke alloy rims  and body extensions  Because of how collectible these trucks are  the  price  is actually higher then what they were back in 1999  I have seen F 150 Lightnings go for around  40 000  New  these trucks had a MSRP of around  30 000 even i Conclusion i While most owners will not utilize the power provided in the Lightning  the Ford Lightning offers amazing performance attributes  This vehicle may not be the best for off road use  in fact off road use is best avoided  however this type of a truck is one that will turn heads and burn rubber  fair enough trade off  The Lightning is recommended 100  to anyone looking for an exclusive  non off road  hot rod production truck Looking to read about another truck  You may want to check out    a href

42,75, In November of 1999  my wife decided that she was interested in an SUV and wanted to trade in our 1997 Dodge Ram  I had bought a 1999 Jeep Wrangler for myself earlier in the year  so who was I to argue We went to all of the differant dealers in the area and checked out the Dodge Durango  the Jeep Grand Cherakee  Chevrolet Blazer  GMC Jimmy and Tahoe  We then went to the Ford Dealer to see an Explorer before we went back to make a deal on the Duango  While walking across the lot to the Explorers my wife spotted the Expeditions  She immediatly locked on to a gold XLT and the Durango was forgotten  A test drive cinched the deal Since then we have taken a 1200 and a 600 mile trip experiencing all types of weather each time  The Expedition is a dream to drive  handles well and the gas mileage is reasonable  We get about 15 mpg in the city and about 18 on the highway  I have owned a good many vehicles in my time including a new Cadillac Sedan Deville and this is my all time pick for comfort  Safety is another factor as you sit nice and high and the Expedition has a nice heavy secure feel  We have the small V8 and power is not lacking When we fold up the third seat we have all of the room we need and if we remove the third seat and fold the second seat the space approximates that of a pickup  Long objects like lumber fit on the roof rack We have added tinted window vents  about  40  tinted front windows  about  70  and a K amp N air filter  about  55  When backing the vehicle seems longer than it is and the rear window being up so high makes it appear that vehicles and objects behind you are closer than they are One special luxury that we enjoy is the power operated adjustable gas and brake pedal  My wife is 5 2 quot  and runs the pedals all the way up and I like to have the lowest pedal setting  A touch of a button is all it takes  The only item I wish that it had was the memory settings for the seat adjustments but we can live without them All in all Ford has a winner with the Expedition  the comfort of a luxury car while giving more room for passengers and cargo  I had doubts at first about getting rid of our pickup because it was so handy  but no more  I am sold on the Expedition  We looked at the Excursion while we were at the Ford dealer but it was just too big for us Try one on for size and I ll bet you will be the next buyer br br  
43,51, I bought my Ford Explorer in 1993 when they weren t the  quot station wagon quot  of the 90 s  I have a dirt road 1 3 mile long with lots of ruts and bumps  I haul pot bellied pigs and my dog  straw  heavy food bags and drive on the lawn  My Explorer has lasted with general maintenance and new tires  This vehicle is great for riding tough  I change the oil regularly and the air filter maybe once a year  This vehicle is not made just for good looks  This vehicle is for someone who wants to run their car  haul  and off road br br  
44,60, My Expy came with a trailer towing package  full power inside and inclement weather package  The motor a 4 8 liter  is very weak on power when towing  If your thinking of buying an Expy and plan on towing anything  I strongly urge you to consider the bigger motor  You will find that while towing anything  slight upgrades in the road will cause your Expy with the little motor to kick out of overdrive and into high gear  If you live in a mountainous area  then be prepared NOT to use overdrive Overall  my Expy is a comfortable ride and we have had little problems with it  The longevity of all Ford motors is proven  but do consider an extended warranty as this vehicle has numerous sensors that can nickle and dime you  I did have a bad ride and alot of road noise with the Goodyear tires that came on the expy from the factory  I switched to Michelins and found the ride much better and the road noise gone  Consider the Michelin LTX M S series tire for your expy if you change tires I enjoy my Expy and found it to be a comfortable ride  easy to manuever  stable at high speeds and during changing lanes and a real joy to drive  Hope you have as good a luck with yours br br  
45,74, I just want to say that I ve had my 1992 4x4 XLT fullsize Bronco for 4 years now and I love it  I couldn t ask for anything more in a vehicle  The first thing that sold me on it was the intimidating appearance of the thing  It looks mean  The interior is very roomy and comfortable and gauges and switches are clear and easy to reach  Currently it has 135 000 miles on it with not a lick of trouble  Everything on the Bronco is stock besides the 33 quot  tires and a Dynomax turbo muffler  The ride is decent for a truck like SUV  but the stiff suspension can really help out when off roading  The 5 0L powerplant is surprisingly powerful  I can beat my friend s stock Chevy Z71 0 60 even with my 33 quot  tires  although he hates when I bring it up  I don t see why people gripe and complain about the reliability of this vehicle  Me and about 8 of my other friends have gone over 120 000 miles on our Broncos  135 000 for me  without incident  I just think that some people don t know what the term  quot routine maintenance quot  means     
46,76, I love my 2000 Mustang  The car that I traded in was a 1992 Ford Mustang convertible  That car gave me a few problems  but I went ahead on and tried another Ford  I was looking for a new car because I was ready to get married  My husband went with me  We both fell in love with this car  I have a Bright Atlantic Blue Mustang  It is a pretty color  I don t see very many of the same color as mine  The interior is light gray and dark gray  The seats are light gray My car has only given me one problem  The air conditioner vents did not turn from side to side  I took the car to the local Ford dealership and told them  They looked at the car and ordered the parts  I took the car back in and they put in new air conditioner vents  This is the only problem I have had  The car is great  The interior of the car is a light gray  The car is an automatic  It has power windows  power door locks  cd player  tape player  cruise control  automatic driver seat  automatic mirrors  overdrive and It has an anti theft device built into the car  If someone doesn t have the right key  the car will not start  I had a key made at Wal Mart and it will unlock the doors  but you can t use it to drive the car with  It also has a remote control for the car  It has lock and unlock for the doors  trunk and panic button The driver panels are the speed  oil gage  temperature gage  gas gage and the battery  It also has lights that light up for different reasons  like the seatbelt  overdrive off  or low fuel  The seatbelt warning goes off every now and then  if you don t buckle your seatbelt up The gear shift is located in between the seats  It has park  reverse  neutral  drive  2  and 1  The overdrive button is located on the gear shift  There is a console in between the front seats  It has slots inside if for cd s  There is also a change tray located between the gear shift and the console  The doors also have  pockets  to place objects in  When I am out on the highway and I want to  get up and go  it goes  Some cars that I have had before if you push the gas it is still going the same speed  Not this one  You want to go  it goes  The car s body style has not changed much over the last few years  I has just been the head lights and tail lights that change  The body is just about the same as it was when they changed to this body style in 1994  The inside of the car is great  I love having the tape deck and the cd player  I have lots of cds but I also have quite a few tapes so that gives me more of an option of what I can listen to  The control panel for the cd player  the tape deck and the air conditioner are all in the middle  That makes it easy to get to for the driver The cruise control is located on the steering wheel  The buttons are cruise  coast  and resume  Cruise is to set it  Coast to slow down  Resume to go back to the speed that you were at before  The windshield wipers are on the side of the steering column  This is also the same as the blinkers and the headlight brightner dimmer  The emergency blinkers are on the top of the steering column  The headlights are on the left side of the steering wheel  There is an interior light for when the doors are open  When you get into the car and close the door  the light stays on until you start the car  This is very helpful at night time to see the ignition  When you get out the light also stays lit until you lock the doors  It also goes off automatically This car has an automatic window defroster for the back window  This helps in the winter time to defrost ice and snow  The heater has defrost  floor and mix  Mix is the floor and defroster  The heater air conditioner is a round circle that goes from cold to hot  blue to red  The air conditioner has max a c  normal a c  and vent  The max blows a little harder than the normal  Vent is just for outside air  The only thing that I don t like is that the seats could be a little softer than what they are  I love the automatic seat for the drivers side  There is not one on the passenger side  But they are ok  The front seats are bucket seats  The back seat is two different seats  They lay down to the inside  In case you have something in the trunk  There is not much leg room in the back seat  It is comfortable enough for my son  He is only five  so he is comfortable in the back seat  Most adults would not be comfortable in the back seat  unless they are short  I have ridden in the back seat  I am 5 5  and there is enough leg room for me  But it is not for very tall people The trunk has an automatic opener on the key chain and also inside the glove box  There is also a safety feature on the inside of the car s trunk  There is a cord to pull in case you get locked in the trunk  to pop the trunk from the inside  The trunk is carpeted and has the donut tire underneath the carpet  It is a pretty roomy trunk for a sports car  My car has a spoiler on the trunk  There is a third brake light in the spoiler This car drives great  The car accelerates when you want it to  It is a fun little car to drive  The brakes also work well  When you need to stop and stop fast  it does  The cars performance driving is great  It takes off and slows down when you want to  It handles the road good  It is easy to drive  I love everything else about my car  My next car after this one will more than likely be another Mustang  They have me sold on this  little pony  If you have not ever had a Mustang you need to drive one  You might really want one after you do  Thank you for reading  Have a good night Kimberly 
47,80, I pull up to the stop light and next to me I see a Porsche Boxster  But you see if I were in any other car I would sit back and stare in awe but I was in my brand new 2000 GT Mustang  This guy in the Porsche was over there thinkin look at this guy thinking he s got a fast car  well I m going to burn him  But when the light turned green i was gone before he could say a word  I love my mustang  I have loved mustangs since they came out  They have always been reliable cars and so far my 2000 has proved to be reliable also  The mustang is one of the sharpest  sleekest  best lookin cars on the road today  The style and performance is unbeatable for the price  If you are lookin for bang for the buck then this is the car for you  I got this car because I wanted a fun reliable car to drive around everyday  I got both out of the mustang  If you are single and want a good car for good money the Mustang is for you br br  
48,53, I have owned a 1985 Ford T Bird  1992 Mercury Cougar and now a 1997 Ford T Bird  These are all essentially the same cars  given differences for model years  These cars are virtually indestructible for American manufactured autos  The  85 went 128K miles  the  92 was at 113K miles when they were sold and the  97 is at 45k miles  I had no major breakdowns on any of these and I was always impressed that when they were emissions tested  required in most states  even at high mileage  each tested well within the clean air standards  This indicates a well built  close tolerance engine  designed to last  Alas they are not made anymore  Ford realized they could make and sell a Ford Taurus Mercury Sable  a smaller car and less costly to produce and sell it for more profit than they ever saw on the T Birds or Cougars  Or you are forced to buy an even pricier Ford Crown Victoria or Mercury Grand Marquis if you like larger and safer auto  These were spiffy road cruisers with good looks  good gas mileage  and performed well for their size  If you can find a low mileage  97  they make a great second or even your main vehicle  These will no doubt be collector items for your children  
49,77, The Ford Windstar is a great minivan for those families out there that are always on the run  I love it  It actually drives like a car even though it is pretty large  It has a nice look and is comfortable  I have had this van for four years and it is still holding up  I recommend this to anyone who wants a minivan that drives great and is worth the price  I bought it for  25 000 and it is great  I have had no problems with this car and recommend it  Take it from me  the Ford Windstar is a great van and worth the price     
50,62, I needed a vehicle with enough room to seat 4 people  2 in car seats  Four doors was something of a must as the extra 2 doors help to make the process of buckling in youngsters go a little smoother  I also wanted something that would be easy on gas as I do a lot of driving  My search did not start out with the Focus in mind  rather I looked at and test drove most of the cars in its class before making a decision  The main selling point for us on this vehicle was the test drive  The car surprised me at how quiet it is and the ride was also good for a small car  Gas mileage on the sticker was posted as 28 city  and 36 highway  The only thing I was not impressed with on the test drive was the visibility but I ll get to that later  A quick check to see how the car seats fit in the back and the rest was a matter of settling on a final price with our local dealer  After owning the Focus for about a month I am still very happy with my choice but there are a few gripes I have with this vehicle  The exterior styling of the sedan version leaves a bit to be desired in my opinion but also contributes to two shortcomings  I can t see the front end of the car nor can I see the back end  from the drivers seat  Pay close attention to this on the test drive as it may prove to be unacceptable to some drivers  The base engine is adequate for the flat terrain where I live but I d opt for the stronger Zetec option if I lived in a hilly or mountainous region  I would also have preferred an extra inch of cleaning surface on the drivers side windshield wiper  One thing to keep in mind when car shopping in this class is the list of standard options  I believe Ford was a little stingy in this respect  Aside from floor mats  rear defrost  interior trunk release  passive anti theft system and AM FM cassette most of the other standard options on the LX sedan are very basic  If you want ABS  AC  automatic transmission  etc  you ll need to add potentially expensive options  Fortunately the gripes have been mild and my overall impression remains high  The 5 speed transmission and clutch have proven thus far to be the smoothest I have used  The car does not have a workmanship defect that I have found and has not needed any repair  The mixed bag of driving I do has yielded almost 32mpg  Driving position is comfortable and the air conditioner has been more than up to the job  According to our insurance agent rates for this vehicle are pretty much average for a small car  As a final bonus the trunk holds more than I expected from a car in this class although the high trunk probably contributes to the lack of rear visibility  If you re in the market for a small car you ll of course want to check out epinions com but might also want to take a look at http carpoint msn com homepage default asp You can check specs  rebate information  pricing  invoice and retail  check safety ratings  compare with similar vehicles  etc
