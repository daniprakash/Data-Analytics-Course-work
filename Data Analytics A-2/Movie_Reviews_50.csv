1,82, films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success   whether they re about superheroes   batman   superman   spawn     or geared toward kids   casper   or the arthouse crowd   ghost world     but there s never really been a comic book like from hell before    for starters   it was created by alan moore   and eddie campbell     who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid  80s with a 12 part series called the watchmen    to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd    the book   or   graphic novel     if you will   is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes    in other words   don t dismiss this film because of its source    if you can get past the whole comic book thing   you might find another stumbling block in from hell s directors   albert and allen hughes    getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in   well   anything   but riddle me this   who better to direct a film that s set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society    the ghetto in question is   of course   whitechapel in 1888 london s east end    it s a filthy   sooty place where the whores   called   unfortunates     are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision    when the first stiff turns up   copper peter godley   robbie coltrane   the world is not enough   calls in inspector frederick abberline   johnny depp   blow   to crack the case    abberline   a widower   has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium    upon arriving in whitechapel   he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly   heather graham   say it isn t so   and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon can t stomach    i don t think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper   so i won t go into the particulars here   other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay    in the comic   they don t bother cloaking the identity of the ripper   but screenwriters terry hayes   vertical limit   and rafael yglesias   les mis   rables   do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end    it s funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because   after all   an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts    and from hell s ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days     who holds back the electric car/who made steve guttenberg a star          don t worry   it ll all make sense when you see it    now onto from hell s appearance   it s certainly dark and bleak enough   and it s surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did   at times   it seems like sleepy hollow 2      the print i saw wasn t completely finished   both color and music had not been finalized   so no comments about marilyn manson     but cinematographer peter deming   don t say a word   ably captures the dreariness of victorian era london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks   even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the black and white comic    oscar winner martin childs    shakespeare in love   production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place    even the acting in from hell is solid   with the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent    ians holm   joe gould s secret   and richardson   102 dalmatians   log in great supporting roles   but the big surprise here is graham    i cringed the first time she opened her mouth   imagining her attempt at an irish accent   but it actually wasn t half bad    the film   however   is all good    2   00   r for strong violence/gore   sexuality   language and drug content  
2,93, i ve noticed something lately that i ve never thought of before    pseudo  substance   hollywood faking deep meanings in their films    have you ever seen a movie that you really enjoyed   then when you look back   you realize there was something missing    more and more   filmmakers seem to be putting out well rehearsed   melodramatic films that evoke strong connotations of being a great film   but if you step aside and reflect on your movie going experience   you may just discover nothing more than elegantly presented fluff    i m not trying to say city of angels is that bad    it had a lot going for it   but somewhere along the way   it faltered    somehow   underneath the seemingly poetic beauty of it all   there was a gigantic hole somebody covered with iridescent performances and glossy cinematography    the predictable ending that shattered our hopes   even though we saw it coming   only added to the disappointment    but for over an hour   city of angels is well worth the time    nicolas cage is seth   a guardian angel who   like hundreds   likely thousands or even millions   of other angels   spends eternity watching over the citizens of mortality   humans never aware of how much celestial intervention occurs in their life    meg ryan   in her most subdued performance yet   plays maggie   a doctor who begins to ponder exactly who it is we re fighting against when we fight to keep someone alive    after losing a patient on the surgery table   these questions envelope maggie   and seth   the angel who was there to oversee the patient s transition into the afterlife   is immediately captivated by the doctor    he begins following and observing maggie   falling more and more in love with her everyday    angels   who we quickly learn are not and never were humans   can not experience human sensations such as taste and touch   but they do have the ability to make themselves seen to anyone they desire    seth s adoration is too much to resist   and eventually he does appear to maggie   quite regularly   although such a thing seems taboo among the angelic community    the angels are interestingly presented   all of them dressed in black and more reminiscent of hitmen than traditional glowing white entities   but it s a nice touch that never seems like a mere attempt at uniqueness    cage is a wonderfully versatile actor   think face/off   raising arizona   and it could happen to you   what a combo !   who slips into the role of a heavenly agent quite nicely but threatens sappiness more than once    it s nice to see ryan pick up roles like this and the one in courage under fire    the two aren t very comparable to each other   but they both deviate from her usual   intelligently ditzy   romantic comedy roles   and it s an impressive side of ryan movie goers rarely have the chance to enjoy    but even though the two leads do an impressive job   it is dennis franz who grabs us with his interpretation of a hospital patient who knows more than meets the eye    it s a shame that with so much going for it   city of angels falters so much in its final stages   leaving us with the realization that an emotionally incredible movie was out there   they just didn t know quite how to get to it    they struggle for an impacting conclusion and wind up with painful thud rather than an exhilarating high    filmmakers should know your final impression will be the one you linger on   remember   and convey to others thru word of mouth   so after telling us for 60+ minutes that this film is a glorious masterpiece   they sure leave us with a disheartening taste of mediocrity in our mouths    based on the german film wings of desire   that being the english title   of course     city of angels is ninety percent success   enough to make most people forgive its shortcomings   even the devastatingly disappointing ending    most movie goers   the non cynics anyway   will be too wrapped up in the surreal atmosphere to give criticism to that which needs to be criticized    nonetheless   city of angels is beautifully captivating   which is probably enough to satisfy those poetic viewers who will appreciate a delve into rich emotional territories    
3,50, there s something about ben stiller that makes him a popular choice among casting directors these days    stiller currently has three projects in circulation   and what other actor can lay claim to that    he s in   there s something about mary     which i * still * haven t seen    and he s in the acerbic   your friends & neighbors     playing a talkative   sexually frustrated drama coach called jerri    now there s   permanent midnight     in which stiller plays another jerry   this one a heroin addicted television writer   last name stahl    there s also something about this industry that pushes bankable stars like stiller into doing drug addiction pictures the minute they ve proved themselves commercially    ewan mcgregor springs to mind who   after successful turns in   emma   and   brassed off     received greater respect and admiration for his mind blowing realization as renton in danny boyle s transatlantic junk fest     trainspotting      the philosophy appears to be a simple one   if you want  em to be taken seriously   make  em do drugs       permanent midnight   is based on the true life experiences of jerry stahl   a successful hollywood writer who   in the mid eighties   had a $5   000 a week job churning out plotlines for disposable tv sitcoms and a $6   000 a week heroin habit    a habit   in stahl s own words     the size of utah      as stahl   stiller contributes a commanding performance    unlike   trainspotting     which was successful in having it both ways by chronicling both the highs and the lows of heroin abuse     permanent midnight   instead focuses on the concept of drug addiction as maintenance    one of the earliest observations in the film is a casual reference to   naked lunch   author william s   burroughs who   when asked why he shoots up first thing in the morning responds     so i can shave      stahl rarely appears to be puncturing veins for the thrill of it all in   permanent midnight     it s so he can talk to his mother on the phone   show up for work on time   even pay his bills    while the film itself occasionally wobbles around along with stahl   the writing   adapted from stahl s autobiography by director david veloz   is controlled and pointed       permanent midnight   shows how stahl moved from new york to l   a   to  again in the author s words     escape the drug scene     yeah   right     why he entered into a convenient marriage with a british tv exec   elizabeth hurley   so impossibly polite you d swear her single profanity was dubbed     and that he conceived a child in between his random hirings and firings    stahl narrates all this in a motel bedroom to a sympathetic lover called kitty   norristown s own maria bello   with whom he spent some rehab time    janeane garofalo is wasted  and miscast  as a heavily bespectacled hollywood talent agent who fails to get her hooks into the doped up wordsmith   and that s stahl himself playing a jaded clinic counselor    stiller   unshaven   burroughs take note   and with lots of mascara around the eyes   has stahl stumble through the film looking like a train wreck but   to his credit   never once pushes his pill popping   needle jabbing performance over the top    the ubiquitous stiller is the reason to see   permanent midnight     a dark   comic   and strangely absorbing study of assisted living    
4,79, the most common   and in many cases the only   complaint against francis ford coppola s 1972 masterpiece the godfather is glamorising of mafia   which is presented as an institution guided by ancient tradition and virtues like honour   loyalty and solidarity more suitable for some gentler   kinder ages    martin scorsese   another italoamerican moviemaker   confronted that perspective with his own   more down to earth vision of mafia in 1973 mean streets   movie that dealt with lower echelons of organised crime    unfortunately for scorsese   his film was unspectacular and too artsy to compete with coppola s influence on mafia portrayals in the movies    seventeen years later scorsese returned to mean streets of new york with another film that dealt with darker side of american organised crime    this film was goodfellas   epic black comedy which is today considered as one of the best and most influential films of 1990s    goodfellas owes some of its initial success and popularity to the fact that it was based on the true story   told in best seller book wiseguy by nicholas pileggi   who would co write the screenplay for the film      the book   as well as the film   chronicled thirty years in the life of henry hill   played by ray liotta     irish italian criminal from new york    at the age of 13 he gets recruited in the criminal organisation of paulie cicero   played by paul sorvino     local mob boss   and gradually climbs up the ladder starting with small errands    after couple of years   together with his best childhood friend tommy de vito   played by joe pesci     he joins the crew of expert thieves led by jimmy conway   played by robert de niro      three of them spend years as best friends and associates   gathering enormous wealth from their criminal enterprises that would culminate with one of the most spectacular robberies in american history    wealth   influence and privileges of men connected with mafia are enough for henry hill to seduce his future wife karen   played by lorraine bracco     who would afterwards remain loyal to her husband despite infidelities   domestic abuse   arrests and would even be accomplice to his own private drug dealing business    but the perfect world of   wiseguys   gradually begins to fall apart   tommy s unpredictable outbursts of homicidal violence   jimmy s reluctance to share his part of the loot with partners and   finally   henry s own drug habit would lead to his downfall and make him question his loyalty to the friends    goodfellas is an excellent example of a film that represents work of a film genius in his full glory    scorsese managed to create a vision which is effective and complete despite being full of contradictions that would ripped the film apart in the hands of less talented filmmaker    world depicted in this film is both ordinary and fascinating    scorsese spares no effort to show us all the violence   hypocrisy and inherent paranoia of organised crime   yet it manages to make it both seductive and funny    after being exposed to two and half hours of the film and three decades of criminal history   based on some notorious real life events     the audience understands why the characters chose such dangerous life paths   trading the superficial and short lasting glamour and prosperity of a criminal to the dullness and poverty of honest citizens    scorsese also manages to break viewer s moralistic inhibitions by showing truly revolting material   scenes that depict personal tragedies   broken homes   human depravity   violence   bloodshed and murder   in all their uncompromising reality   but in a manner that would make it amusing and funny to the audience    with the use of ironic soundtrack   manipulative shots   character s dialogue or narrator s commentary   goodfellas represents the new standards of black humour that would became very popular few years later during tarantino era    even if we don t pay attention to skills with which potentially disturbing material becomes eye pleasing and entertaining   we should admit that scorsese displays his talents of truly original and creative filmmaker    first   we might notice unusual structure of the plot   relatively minor subplot is used as movie s ironic prologue    then   instead of single narrator   scorsese switches to the second character as narrator in the middle of the film only to switch back to the original shortly afterwards    this multiple points of views   both in terms of narration and various subjective shots   only lengthens the ironic distance towards characters and their situation    same ironic distance comes with extremely effective choice of soundtrack    nostalgia for good old times is illustrated with easy listening 1950s pop songs   while depression   paranoia and bad times find their expression in more neurotic rock songs of late 1960s and 1970s    but the soundtrack is most effective when it is used as ironic comment   almost pastoral   easy listening tunes make strong and very ironic contrast to the scenes of violence and bloodshed    however   thing most associated with this film is couple of continuos shots that feature characters moving through large rooms and interacting with dozens if not hundreds of people    such scenes   although they require very great skill and patience during their shootings   became very popular among other directors in 1990s    fragmentary character of the screenplay   which doesn t have straight plot and instead bases film on series of loosely connected vignettes   gives another interesting opportunity for scorsese    he uses this structure of film to experiment   and most successful of such experiments is hilarious   a day in life   segment near the end of the film    another essential element of goodfellas is large but superb collection of great acting talents    the most respectable among them is robert de niro   but his character   who happen to be most quiet and business like member of criminal trio   gets overshadowed by two of his friends and colleagues    joe pesci deserved his   oscar   for supporting role of homicidal psychopath tommy   and his lines   including ad libs   probably represent the most memorable element of the film    ray liotta   although equally talented   perhaps doesn t look as the best choice for narrator and nominal hero of the film    liotta s henry hill looks somewhat too hollywoodised and glamorous among this bunch of low level street thugs    liotta   on the other hand   improves general impression by very realistic and menacing portrayal of drug addiction    lorraine bracco is   on the other hand   very effective and believable as karen hill   wife who gradually descends into same moral cesspool as her husband    paul sorvino is also very effective as patriarch mafioso   and among the supporting cast most memorable is chuck low as pestering small time gangster who unknowingly digs his own grave    as a combination of clever sociological study   black humour and innovative filmmaking goodfellas became something only the truly great films could do   work of art and excellent popular entertainment in the same time    because of this achievement   and also because of the great influence on future filmmakers   this cinematic gem deserves its rightful place among the best films of 1990s

co producers stan wlodkowski alan ball music by thomas newman costume designer julie weiss film editor tariq anway chris greenbury production designer naomi shohan director of photography conrad l   hall   a   s   c    produced by bruce cohen & dan jinks written by alan ball directed by sam mendes     both my wife and daughter think i m this gigantic loser    and they re right    i have lost something    i didn t always feel this sedated      with that piece of dialogue   we are fully introduced to lester burnham   kevin spacey     a 42 year old man trapped within his own life    lester works for an advertising agency    his growing dissatisfaction with his job is only one of the mid life crisis he is suffering    estranged from both his wife and his daughter   lester starts to crack under the stress    his life becomes nothing more than a series of mastubatory fantasies   and sullen apathy    carolyn burnham   annette bening     is the prototypical career woman/ homemaker    she carefully tends her rose garden   decorates her home with the best furnishings    but inside she is desperate    unsuccessful at her profession as a real estate agent   she drives herself into states of denial and self loathing that only feed her growing resentment towards her family    the third member of this anti family is jane burnham   thora birch     lester and carolyn s daughter    a young girl going through the typical stages of adolescence   but having to also come to terms with her families growing dysfunction    this funny   and frightening   slice of life is refreshingly simple    not one character is given less than is needed to identify him or her    some of the most telling characters are those that serve to highlight other characters    most notably is barbara fitts   allison janney     the almost catatonic wife of retired marine colonel fitts    she has almost no dialogue   and seems to be either recovering from a stroke or suffering from one    colonel fitts   chris cooper   is an angry and frightened man    his rage directed almost singularly at his son   ricky   wes bentley   who has just moved with his family to the same neighborhood as the burnham s    in fact they are the next door neighbors    anymore detail into the personalities of these marvelously diverse characters would deprive one of the many pleasures and surprises to be had in   american beauty      alan ball   who was the co executive producer of the hit tv series   cybil   and creator of the new sitcom   oh grow up     has fashioned one of the most insightful and expertly tuned screenplays to have hit the screen in the past ten years    not one character in this film rings falsely    and the depth of personality in each   is achingly honest and insightful    the plot detailing the last year in the life of a man as he tries to find his own self worth is so resoundingly cliched and at the same time original as to bring to mind such marvelous film work as   the graduate   or   lolita      kevin spacey turns in one of this years most pragmatic performances    his lester burnham is an everyman caught up in the middle of a life that is spiraling into old age    finally unable to deal with the lost soul that he has become   lester tries to return to his youth    he quits his job   actually blackmailing his employer for one year s salary     starts smoking pot   fantasizes about his daughter s girlfriend angela   mena suvari   in a marvelous performance here     starts working out   and finally takes a job at the local fast food outlet    mr   spacey s performance is so remarkably subtle and ingenuous   that we can be certain that come oscar   time   we can be assured to see him name among the five nominees    annette bening also turns in what may be the best performance of her career    carolyn burnham is a woman who has become so insecure as to be caught up in maintaining the facade of normalcy    unable to cope with her growing disillusionment   she forces herself to maintain her demeanor   driving her further and further into desperation   adultery and possibly murder    ms   bening makes the character of carolyn so compelling as to be identifiable to almost anyone    the slow and methodical turn from happy home maker to charnel house martha stewart is too frightening to express in words    thora birch holds her own against the talents cast with her    jane burnham is both an innocent girl caught up in what is a dysfunctional family   and a rebellious child ready to abandon them at any moment    her growing distrust and isolation from her family is something that many parents should view as a warning    she is the prototypical trophy child    when carolyn praises her daughter after a performance by her cheerleading team     i m so proud of you   honey    you didn t screw up once !       the bitterness and resentment are palpable    thora birch is a young actress to watch    praise must also go to chris cooper who brings yet another angry father role to life with depth and resonance    colonel finn is a man in complete denial    his military upbringing masking a desire he is too repulsed to even comprehend    wes bentley as ricky finn is fine as the enigma    the boy next door who may be more foe than friend    a deceitful and calculating young man   whose voyeuristic proclivities mask a deeper and more profound understanding of life than any of the adults around him    mr   bentley s performance is the one troublesome note in the film    that is simply because the character is such a grand and complete liar   that one almost faults the performance for it    director sam mendes handles all of the particulars of the cast and the settings with a sure and composed style that is neither intrusive nor subtle    scenes of carolyn walking through the rain   carry an ominous fission that calls attention to the emotions of the character    the subtle cinematography by conrad hall is wonderful   capturing the season in all of it s harsh beauty   fall has never looked so inviting   yet depressing      every nuance of   american beauty   begs it s audience to think and examine    it is a film that will be discussed and debated for years to come    and well it should   as it is simply one of this years best

7,54, why do so many children s films treat their target audience with utter contempt    too many of those who write or direct for children s movies assume that the kids just can t handle serious   thoughtful discussions on meaningful issues       the iron giant     which was directed and co written by brad bird   late of such animated series as   the simpsons   and   king of the hill     assumes that not only can children handle such discussions   but that they can do so while being entertained at the same time       the iron giant   holds absolutely no contempt for the young people in the audience   making it a film that s enjoyable for both children and adults alike    hogarth hughes   voice of eli marienthal   is a spirited young lad who lives with his hard working single mother   annie   jennifer aniston     in a small town in maine    after staying up late and watching scary movies on a night his mother is away   hogarth treks out into the forest to investigate what has stolen his antenna and ruined his tv reception    he comes across a giant robot   vin diesel   from space that eats metal for food    after saving the robot   nicknamed the iron giant   from electric shock   hogarth befriends the creature and takes him in as a pet of sorts    because of damage he suffered upon landing   the giant has forgotten what his original mission was   so he just follows hogarth around like a lost puppy    realizing he can t just keep the giant in a barn all the time   and that the giant needs food   he takes him to a junkyard owned by dean   harry connick jr       an eccentric artist who assembles sculptures out of scrap iron in his spare time    it soon becomes apparent that dean and hogarth can t keep the giant a secret forever   because a government spook named kent mansley   christopher mcdonald   has been brought in to investigate mysterious sightings in the surrounding forest area and considers the giant a threat to national security    he suspects hogarth knows something about the giant   and takes up residence in hogarth s house as a lodger    meanwhile   the giant begins to exhibit ominous behavior that suggests he was built to be a weapon of some kind       the iron giant   is exactly what family films ought to be   because it doesn  t talk down to its audience    the story is simple   very simple   about an alien being that drops out of the sky and befriends a young boy    it s very similar to the spielberg classic   e   t       and such comparisons are actually deserved in the case of   the iron giant      the film holds many of the better elements of spielberg s film   such as the ability to be sentimental without turning sappy    the film delivers several serious messages   the most important of which is one s ability to choose one s own fate    hogarth teaches the giant to go against his programming and become what he wants to be   a hero    the final sequence is touching and appropriate   though i won t give it away   i will say that very few will be disappointed    the animation   while not up to disney standards   what could be   after   tarzan         is good enough to make you forget you re watching a cartoon    the giant is computer animated   while the human characters are all hand drawn the old fashioned way    the characters  faces are done quite well   drawn realistically enough to make the personalities credible   but the features are exaggerated so as to allow for the cartoonish expressions that provide for comic relief    fine voice work is turned in by young eli marienthal as hogarth   and jennifer aniston is surprisingly convincing as his waitress mother    harry connick jr   does a nice characterization as dean   and i really enjoyed the voice work of john mahoney   of tv s   frasier     as an army general called in by agent mansley    unlike several cartoon features   each character is actually a developed personality   rather than a stereotype   and is actually integral to the plot   rather than being a superfluous comic relief sidekick   a clich   disney still hasn t ditched      dean   for example   could have been a stereotypical beatnik   his character profile seems to suggest that     but he is presented as a character with real emotions   thoughts   and motivations    even the heavy   agent mansley   is not a villain who does bad things simply because he wants to   but out of his own fear and paranoia    a lesser animated feature would have drawn up paper thin stereotypes and figure the kids won t mind   but   the iron giant   has clearly put a little work into making the characters real   and it pays off    the film isn t only around to deliver heavy handed messages   though    it s also very funny   and the humor is of the kind that both children and adults will enjoy    the scenes in which hogarth teaches the giant to do certain things   such as dive into a pool   are handled well   and director brad bird clearly has a sense of comic timing   having worked on   the simpsons   for many years    a sequence where hogarth and mansley attempt to   outlast   one another by trying to stay awake is very nicely timed   and also extremely clever    the film even takes some jabs at america s nuclear paranoia during the early stages of the cold war   satirizing the lame safety films shown to grade school students that tell them to   duck and cover   in the event of a nuclear attack       the iron giant   has much more of a satirical edge to it than most family films   and the edgy humor is actually quite refreshing    instead of seeing people get bonked on the head   we get well timed   clever gags that seem to have required some imagination to come up with    when you get right down to it     the iron giant   is no more than the story of a boy and his robot    the story is so straightforward   so quaint   that it ultimately becomes charming    though i enjoy the complex plotting of film noir as much as the next person   when it comes to family entertainment   simple is the way to go    it s akin to one of those bedtime stories your father told that had you hanging on his every word   but it s not the story that sets the film above others of its kind   but rather the elements that go into the story   namely real characters and thoughtful dialogue   which   the iron giant   has in spades    
8,56, no film in recent has left me with such conflicted feelings as neil jordan s harrowing   humorous   horrifying adaptation of patrick mccabe s novel about young lad francie brady s   eamonn owens   descent into madness in 1960s ireland    on one hand   it was difficult for me to become invested in francie s story because he is such an unsavory character   unjustifyably venting his rage at his nosy but otherwise harmless neighbor mrs   nugent   fiona shaw      on another hand   i found it difficult to laugh at some of francie s darkly comic shenanigans because he obviously is such a sick   needy child   having been raised by a drunken father   stephen rea   and a suicidal mother   aisling o sullivan      on yet another hand   i also found it difficult to completely sympathize with francie during his more emotional scenes because some of his   for lack of a better word     bad   deeds are so incredibly shocking in their brutality and the malicious glee in which he performs them    however   the butcher boy s power is undeniable   and the film as a whole is unforgettable  perhaps because it is so disturbing    what makes it so unsettling is the francie s overall wink wink yet matter of fact attitude about everything   expressed in a cheeky voiceover narration delivered by the adult francie   rea again      think heavenly creatures played largely for laughs   and you ll sort of understand    anchoring the whole film is the astonishing debut performance of owens   love francie or hate him   you cannot take your eyes off of owens    the butcher boy truly is a twisted   unusual film that is bound to make just about anyone uncomfortable    in the lobby after the screening   i overheard one man raving about how great yet disturbing it was   i also heard one particularly offended woman say with disgust     that movie was so unfunny !       i didn t know what to expect    it s like something you chase for so long   but then you don t know how to react when you get it    i still don t know how to react        michael jordan   on winning his first nba championship in 1991       or    my thoughts after meeting him on november 21   1997  
9,58, meet joe black   reviewed on nov   27/98    starring brad pitt   anthony hopkins   claire forlani  in   meet joe black     brad pitt plays death    that s all that really needs to be said   but nevertheless   i will provide the three of you that have seemingly been living in a cave with a plot description    death decides to take a holiday   what with all the rigors of soul collecting and all   and forces anthony hopkins into showing him what it s like to be human    death assumes the body of brad pitt   and from there   much trouble ensues    for one thing   death as pitt falls in love with hopkins daughter   played by claire forlani    obviously this enrages hopkins   because really   what can death offer    besides eternal damnation   of course    there is also a sub plot about forlani s ex boyfriend   she dumps him for pitt   trying to take over hopkins company       meet joe black   runs just under three hours    i ve always thought that such obscene running times should be limited to historical epics       meet joe black   is neither historical nor is it an epic   though i get the feeling martin brest   the director   desperately wants it to be    every single scene in the movie goes on about 3 4 minutes too long    and the ending takes about 20 minutes longer than it really should    a severe editing job could have made this movie excellent   instead of just good   which is what it is    pitt   an actor i normally loathe   is actually quite engaging as death    i believed his performance   and i could see why forlani s character would fall in love with him    i have to agree with roger ebert   though   who found it hard to believe that an entity that s been around for all time wouldn t know what peanut butter was    that has nothing to do with pitt s performance   of course   but it is a little distracting    hopkins gives his usual excellent performance    he s able to portray the angst of a man who knows he has very little time left   without making him an obnoxious whiner    and in her first major studio role   claire forlani is surprisingly good    she has a sweet tenderness that allows the audience to instantly root for her    so     meet joe black   is a good movie hampered by it s ridiculous running time    had the film been cut by an hour or so   i have no doubt that i would be calling it one of the best movies of the year in this review    
10,78, not since oliver stone s natural born killers has there been a movie this incendiary   and not since david cronenberg has a so called mainstream director been this willing to repeatedly tiptoe the fine line between pointed social commentary and outright social irresponsibility    while fincher s films have never suffered from a lack of shock value   his major character killings in both alien 3 and seven are fine examples     fight club marks the distillation of his pitch black comedic sensibility   see 1997 s the game   into something like a definitive statement    jack   norton   acting as both narrator and protagonist   is your typical cubicle clone   whose disillusionment is amplified by a seemingly incurable insomnia    on the offhand advice of a doctor   he sits in on group therapy sessions for everything from blood parasites to testicular cancer    here he meets bob   marvin lee aday   aka meat loaf     a cancer emasculated eunuch with profound gynecomastia    strangely   the release he finds while sobbing on bob s breasts allows him to sleep at night   at least until a fellow group therapy   tourist   named marla singer   carter   comes along to ruin things for him   forcing a grudging compromise that recalls monty python in its dark hilarity    later   he meets tyler durden   pitt     a soap salesman with a decidedly subversive outlook on life    one night   after his ikea  furnished condo explodes   don t ask   you ll just have to see the movie   awright       he is goaded by tyler into a fight   and damned if it doesn t feel good    it is pure   raw existence   a brief moment of clarity and purpose that makes his dreary workaday life pale in comparison    he moves into tyler s squalid abandoned mansion   and they form the titular organization   an underground therapy group where men bond with bare knuckle savagery and very few rules   the first two of which are   don t talk about fight club      armed with charisma and an attractive anti corporate philosophy   tyler assumes leadership of the burgeoning membership of white collar slaves and dead end mcemployees    resentment creeps into jack s heart   made worse by the fact that tyler is also regularly and noisily boffing the hated marla    funded by a frivolous lawsuit   tyler begins molding his devotees into an army dedicated to mischief and mayhem    their initially juvenile pranks   like pissing in food and putting spike belts on roads   quickly evolve into something more like sedition   and jack fears that things have gone sour    it is after this point   when you are plenty uncomfortable and wondering just how far fincher will go to say something original   that the film uncorks a disappointing plot twist    it is so contrived   and so conventional compared to what precedes it   that everything which follows   including the ending   becomes far less interesting    it s a major   though not fatal   flaw   and for a director as notoriously unpredictable as fincher   it feels like a cop out    fight club is going to be misconstrued by a great many people    in the early going   it has a downright dangerous feel   it seems to be saying that violence and civil disobedience are good for the soul   and this is undoubtedly the message that a few moronic punks are going to take from it    i ll be mightily surprised if imitation fight clubs don t spring up here and there   and i ll be even more amazed if fincher isn t vilified for it by the same humorless witch hunters that are currently after oliver stone    they needn t bother   because fight club is less a message movie than fincher s elaborate attempt at a joke    tyler durden   for all his dionysian allure   is really nothing more than the logical   and far less hypocritical   extrapolation of all those self help gurus who constantly show up on oprah to preach their me first gospel of self actualization    in this context   the joke works   but like the latest columbine joke   some people will get it and enjoy a good laugh   and others won t    hopefully   though   their silly moral outrage won t spoil the joke for the rest of us    
11,72, disaster films have a tendency to be very formulated and very cliched    to see a disaster film with actual originality   or at least a decent plot twist   would definitely be a welcome surprise    unfortunately   folks   it s not likely    dante s peak is cliched   and at times corny   but also pretty decent    to be honest   i wasn t very interested in seeing this film   and word of mouth   as well as several reviews   didn t make it sound promising    so i was pleasantly surprised that to find that this movie wasn t bad at all    it s pretty run of the mill   but it s not something i would say is merely   ok   to watch    in case you don t know   dante s peak is about a volcano and the city which lives in it s shadow   dante s peak   who would ve guessed   eh        pierce brosnan plays the volcanologist sent to study the volcano and   perhaps more by hunch than actual scientific proof   is determined that the volcano will be arupting in the very near future    due to the lack of more substantial evidence   nobody warns the small town   and when they finally do   it s in the middle of the town meeting that the volcano finally blows    brosnan   all around good guy   will   of course   save the day            or at least the mayor of dante s peak   linda hamilton      naturally the two will become infatuated with one another       if you think i just ruined a plot development   you haven t seen very many movies !    there s also the virtually neccessary kids and pet dog to tug at your heart strings    and of course   the kids or the dog   at least one or the other   will do something heroic            but hey   i don t want to ruin all the surprises !  if there was a part of you that was hesitating seeing dante s peak merely because it was rumored to be a waste of time   i urge you to watch it and decide for yourself    it s not brain food   but it succeeds at what it s meant to be            an enjoyable   suspenseful movie about the fury mother nature can unleash !  
12,61, while watching wes anderson s rushmore   it may be surprising to think that the role of max fischer   the film s anti hero   was not written with jason schwartzman in mind    the young actor   making his film debut as a 15 year old student at the exclusive rushmore academy is so perfect in the role that it comes as a shock that anderson auditioned some two thousand other prospective stars before discovering schwarztman    schwartzman plays max   a student who is more interested in his extra curricular activities   such as writing edgy plays like   serpico   and being president of the rushmore beekeepers   but sees his grades suffer as a result    on the brink of being thrown out   he lands himself in even more hot water when he falls for first grade teacher rosemary cross   olivia williams   and enlists the help of millionaire acquaintance herman blume   the great bill murray   to build an aquarium   on rushmore s baseball field   in her honour    unfortunately for everyone involved   blume finds that he has feelings for miss cross as well   which gets in the way of max s plans to woo her    max is one of the best written characters we ve yet seen in the 90s   and schwartzman plays him to perfection in one of the finest comedy performances ever given by someone of his age    as everyone else has probably already pointed out   he is reminiscent of a young dustin hoffman   although i was reminded more of paul from   the wonder years     from a visual standpoint   at least      hopefully   if he avoids typecasting as weird   quirky loner types he should earn himself a good career    bill murray is his equal as blume   displaying a depth we haven t yet seen from him    while this isn t his best performance   that honour goes to groundhog day   he is still terrific here    williams isn t given much to do except react to schwartzman and murray   but still does fine work    rushmore seems to go just a little too long but   while it isn t a perfect film   it is a definate must see for anyone who wants to see that rarity   an american coming of age film that actually works well without an excessive amount of sentimentality    anderson has created a modern classic with a star who should   with any luck   rise to even greater success    
13,63, the cryptic teaser trailer has been unspooling in moviehouses for quite sometime now     it mu5t be found      so what   exactly   is the fifth element    after seeing luc besson s ambitious   much shrouded in secrecy science fiction fantasy   i could not help but be let down by the actual answer   which is not nearly as exciting nor clever as one would think    but what is far from a letdown is the film as a whole   a wildly imaginative feast for the senses that does what all the best science fiction films do  create a universe unlike any other presented on the silver screen    the biggest irony of the fifth element is that the one thing that has been kept under such tight wraps  the actual storyline  is the most conventional   dismayingly so   element   pun intended   of the film    speaking in the vaguest possible terms   the basics of the plot are as follows   in the year 2259   a great force of evil threatens to consume the earth   and only the four elements  earth   wind   fire   and water  united with a fifth element can stop it    figuring into all of this are new york cabbie korben dallas   bruce willis     a shady   southern drawling entrepreneur by the name of zorg   the hilariously hammy gary oldman   picking up where he left off in besson s the professional     a priest   ian holm     and a mysterious creature named leeloo   milla jovovich      all of the pieces come together in a tidy and somewhat underwhelming  and unsurprising  fashion   but there is no denying that this basic story holds some intrinsic interest    what remains interesting and exciting   however   after brief glimpses is the fascinating world besson has created with production designer dan weil   director of photography thierry arbogast   visual effects supervisor mark stetson   and the crew at digital domain    the look is absolutely mesmerizing right from the opening moments to the last    the frenzied cityscape of new york   with its vibrant day glo colors   tall buildings penetrating high into the clouds   and the swarm of cars   cabs   and other vehicles flying through labyrinthian skyways   is absolutely breathtaking to behold   especially in a wild car chase sequence early on in the film    but it would not have been a completely captivating vision if the people inhabiting the settings weren t equally as interesting   and are they ever    in addition to the exotic menagerie of alien creatures that populate this world   from bulky robots to dog like mangalores   the humans are outfitted in costumes by eccentric designer jean paul gaulthier   best known for creating madonna s pointy bustier get up in her blonde ambition tour    gaulthier s outlandish creations   such as a number worn by leeloo made entirely out of white straps   feel more at home in besson s futuristic vision than on any fashion runway in the world   they add to the sense of otherworldliness about the film    while besson s bold vision is the biggest virtue of the film   it also could be its biggest obstacle to reaching a mass audience    for all its imagination   certain things about the film may be a bit too quirky and bizarre    i really do not know what middle america will make of the most outrageous character of the film   ruby rhod   chris tucker     a flamboyant disc jockey who makes dennis rodman look conservative  he makes a raucous entrance dressed in an animal print dress   sporting a blonde hairdo in the shape of a hair dryer   speaking in high pitches at rapid fire speed    at first this character s hyper energy is funny   but the act wears out its welcome very quickly    not irritating   but just as strange   is a musical number by blue skinned alien chanteuse diva   maiwenn lebesco     who sings  and dances  an aria that is an unlikely blend of classical opera and techno    the tune   as with the entirety of longtime besson collaborator eric serra s innovative score   is haunting   but it is also completely jarring    then there are the campy touches of humor besson and co scripter robert mark kamen sprinkle throughout   which too often are silly and forced   a comic sexual encounter between ruby rhod and a flight attendant is highly distracting and not very funny   to boot    the story s weakness shines through in the climax and conclusion of the fifth element    while still visually and aurally spectacular   the events detailed are not as exciting nor powerful as they should be    the big   serious dramatic climax was met with more than a few snickers   and it ambitiously strives for a profundity which the film had not even begun to work toward    as such   at the end there is a sense that there was something bigger at work here   that there was still more left to be said about this story and these characters    this suspicion was confirmed by besson himself   who told me in the lobby following the screening   imagine that   the filmmaker watching the film with the   enemy     the critics   that what had made it to the screen was really just the first half of the lengthy original fifth element screenplay and that the second half  now titled mr   shadow  is still waiting to be made    still   despite the story problems   the fifth element is an artistic triumph for luc besson   rarely does a filmmaker s original vision come to the screen in all its audacious   undiluted glory    it is a fascinating example of how of one artist s fervid imagination can transport an audience into an intoxicating fantasy world generally seen only in dreams    
14,73, jack nicholson has a funny way of playing characters with very few redeeming qualities   but whom you end up liking anyway    in as good as it gets   the character in question is melvin udall   a successful novelist with obsessive compulsive disorder who seems bent on having as little contact with people around him as possible   except when he feels like being a royal pain in the you know where    he s mean    i mean really mean    the opening scene shows him shoving a little dog down the trash chute of his manhattan condominium    every day   melvin eats at the same cafe   sits at the same table   and gets served by the same waitress    you can tell that this is his favorite place to be a vicious nuisance   when his waitress carol   helen hunt   tells him he can just go sit in another section   and all the other waitresses just cringe    one day   melvin makes a comment that goes to far   and carol   genuinely hurt   comes down on him like a ton of bricks    at that point we find that she is not only the only person who can put up with him as a matter of course   but is also the only person who can get to him   too    another person who often crosses melvin s sights is simon   greg kinnear     an artist who lives on melvin s floor    aside from the fact that he lives near the terror of the city   simon has the added benefit of being gay   making him a prime target    simon s friend frank   cuba gooding   jr       also gay   does not fare much better    when simon walks in on a pair of men robbing his apartment   he is brutally beaten and sent to the hospital   and frank   who has grown tired of seeing his friend take the verbal abuse dished out by his neighbor   intimidates melvin into watching after simon s dog while he convalesces    this is the same dog melvin had earlier shoved down the garbage    an interesting thing happens when melvin takes this dog in   melvin gets to like the dog   and the two develop an attachment which is the catalyst to melvin s softening up to the world around him    it doesn t happen overnight   but throughout the film   he bites his tongue here   cares a little there   and most miraculously   falls in love    one of the best elements of this film is watching melvin try to express feelings which are not the usual negative ones he so often shares with others    he s traveling terra incognita here   and it shows    good performances are turned in by all principal players in this film   especially by nicholson and hunt    they play well off of each other and have a genuine chemistry which makes it a pleasure to watch them on screen    greg kinnear   who is becoming known for his supporting film roles   is also very good at playing the vulnerable simon    he gives a short monologue about what it means for him to be an artist   and delivers it with such inspiration and conviction that you actually get to feel some of what he feels    cuba gooding jr   performs with a hyped up level of energy which contrasts nicely with that of kinnear   and comes through with a near constant comic performance    the screenplay   by mark andrus and james l   brooks   is clever   touching   and funny    the best part about it   however   is that it is filled with characters we care about because they are actually interesting    melvin is a man we can t quite figure out   but whose mannerisms and quirky qualities capture our attention    carol is a working woman living with her mother   trying to take care of a child with a debilitating respiratory problem    simon is a man who is a success in his circle of peers   but who is still not accepted by much of society    combined with the talent of the actors   these characters make the film    the one noticeable area where the film is lacking   however   is the absence of cuba gooding   jr   through the second half    his character makes an exit which is supposed to be temporary   but the film ends before his return   leaving his relationship with simon and melvin unresolved    i would have liked to have seen more of his character in general   in addition to a part in the film s conclusion    there s one actor   who will probably not be recognized by any awards   but who contributes greatly to many of the movie s best scenes and who deserves mention    this is that little dog    he plays such a pivotal role to melvin s character development   actually serves to forward the plot   and has some absolutely scene stealing moments   that it is hard to believe he is simply an animal    award or no   however   when even the dog puts in a good performance   you know you ve got an outstanding movie    
15,80, i don t know what movie the critics saw   but it wasn t this one    the popular consensus among newspaper critics was that this movie is unfunny and dreadfully boring    in my personal opinion   they couldn t be more wrong    if you were expecting airplane !  like  laughs and agatha christie intense mystery   then yes   this movie would be a disappointment    however   if you re just looking for an enjoyable movie and a good time   this is one to see    honest   it is    this story is about a 4th network   wbn   taking to america s airwaves in 1939    penny henderson   mary stuart masterson     the station owner s secretary   must deal with her overbearing boss   an unimpressed sponsor and writers ready to quite on a moment s notice   partly due to the fact that they haven t been paid in weeks    among the mayhem   she must also deal with her soon to be ex husband   roger   brian benben   who desperately wants her back    unfortunately   her problems only get worse as the night goes on and the body count rises without explanation    while trying to woo penny back   roger must deal with the police and try to find the killer that lurks at wbn    mary stuart masterson does well in her role as penny   i m trying to be unbiased so i won t tell you how amazing she looked     although brian benben gets most of the screen time    along with the two leads   are several recognizable faces   including corbin bernsen   l   a    law     michael mckean   laverne & shirley   and bobcat goldthwait    the special effects are amazing   and fooled me   which some may argue isn t very difficult to do   in many scenes    although the movie sometimes goes overboard with the physical comedy   it more than makes up for those mistakes throughout the movie    overall   i gave it   or an   depending on what system you use    some comments collected from friends    
16,58, i tried hard not like this movie without succeeding    it contains parts of bringing up baby   any hepburn/tracy film   part of the plot of war games   cary grant and rosalind russell in his girl friday   elevator shaft action   train action   and murder    it is cute   funny   suspenseful   a little bit     sexy   a little bit      one of the bad guys was a surprise    the pace is fast enough   there are some   action   scenes    i think that this is a reasonable family summer movie for families with older kids who have already seen maverick    julia roberts and nick nolte are fine separately and together    i really identified with the julia roberts character   wishful thinking   i know !     but i do have better hair !  her hair   a very dull dark brown   has no color    she could use some highlights    they both do fine with their roles   he s a bored columnist with the chicago chronicle and she s a hotshot   cub   reporter with the chicago globe    they have great fun trying to out scoop each other to solve one case throughout this movie    i like the one story focus    other actors include charles martin smith as roberts  boss   olympia dukakis as nolte s coworker   nora dunn also with the chronicle   and marsha mason as a congresswoman    basically this movie is reasonably fun    there is a serious mystery to solve   and i enjoyed following a fun couple solving the mystery    it is a pleasant change of pace from movies that take themselves seriously    i do give successful comedy high marks    
17,53, whew   this film oozes energy   the kind of breakneck   no  holds barred   in your face risk taking filmmaking that is seldom seen on screen these days    like the marginal   motley bunch of post apocalyptic youths director danny boyle tries to depict   trainspotting veers on the edge of utter mayhem but ultimately retains its footing and control    the result   a movie that is a delightful example of how the medium is the message    the message   a bunch of losers with loser names   mark renton   ewan mcgregor     spud   ewan bremner     sick boy   jonny lee miller     tommy   kevin mckidd     and begbie   robert carlyle      bored   aimless and restless   their routine consists of getting drunk at the local pub   grooving to techno or glam rock at the local disco and getting shots up the arm at the local den and procuring cash through a variety of methods   some ingenious   others plainly dumb and desperate    not part of the daily dose if obtained   sex is a bonus    you can find these characters as they are   foul mouthed   dirty   pathetic   ugly perhaps but definitely interesting   in irvin welsh s cult novel of the same name    what makes the film a completely different experience is how director boyle uses every tool at his disposal to make the filmic medium synchronous with the message    one of the first things you ll notice is how the camera seems to dart around restlessly    it ll truck into a character s pimple   just as soon as it will dolly out to an establishing shot    distracted and curious   it ll maintain a character s eye level or drop right to the ground to show the doped out eye view    you ll even find characters peering into the camera   their faces smeared across the wide angle lens    this film camera is just another one of the guys    tiptoeing that indistinguishable line between fantasy and reality   boyle employs a healthy dose of surrealism to get the message across    bored kids daydream and bored kids deprived of a heroin fix have nightmares    i don t want to give too much away   but if you cross chuckie from child s play with some of the wacky fantasies in heavenly creatures   you might have an idea just how fun or pants wetting scary the alternate state of consciouness can be    that said   this film has a good share of drugs   consumed   vomitted   defecated   pissed off   exchanged   bought   sold   injected   smuggled   enjoyed and regretted    if that isn t your cup of tea   nobody forced you to see the film    stay at home and rent up close and personal    and what s a buzz without tunes    from pulp to iggy pop   yes   he s still alive     the aural landscape is as engaging as the visual energy permeating the film    good and bad vibrations tangle like the conflicting desires and values of the message    every once in a while   a film comes along with the kind of energetic filmmaking that matches the intensity of its characters it hopes to depict    trainspotting is that shooting star that burns across a sky littered with static constellations    dom is a part time filmmaker who graduated from northwestern university s radio/tv/film programme not too long ago    he has laboured on various music videos and short films in and around campus and chicago    nowhere town   a 26min short film that he shot   co directed and co produced recently scooped up the grand jury prize at the charleston international film festival for best student production    he is currently finishing a couple of small projects    with his minute amounts of leisure time   dom does nell impersonations

19,58,    a bug s life   may not be   toy story     but it s more close than   antz   was    i really liked   antz     basically because   yes   it is clever and witty and intelligent   and it has the temerity to take a chance and put woody allen in the lead   perhaps the year s most inspired casting     but there was   in fact   something missing from it   and i m the first to admit that    maybe it s that it never totally lets go and takes off into real innocent fun   it s too obsessed with its orwellian message to become totally engaging   and if it weren t for woody allen   it would have been just a really clever good not great flick       a bug s life   has a similar premise   and it also has disney to insure that it s g rated and not totally over kids  heads like   antz   was   not a bad thing   believe me     but what it also has is a tone that s completely innocent even when it s also remaining perpetually clever       antz   is still the more witty film   and i love it for it   and   a bug s life   is more for general consumption   but it s also more entertaining    it broadens its horizons   and when it really moves from the ant colony   it really shows us a whole new world we ve never seen before   and it s take on the evolution of bugs is a lot better than the one in   antz      it s also light and clever    the visuals are   instead of earth tones   bright worldly colors   and still gives the amazing visual technology of   antz   at least a worthy contender    the characters are also nicely realized   though watered down for broad consumption   they still carry more wit than the contemporary disney animated films    the lead character   flik   voiced by dave foley     is nothing more than a slightly less neurotic z from   antz     but foley makes him nearly as engaging as allen made z   instead of gene hackman playing the villain   we get the much more menacing kevin spacey as the lead grasshopper   the nicely titled hopper    and for the romantic lead   we don t get spacey sharon stone   but intelligent and hard to get julia louis dreyfuss   who doesn t even come around until the very final frames    not that the plot s really any better than the one in   antz     it s basically yet another redux of   the seven samurai     with an ant colony under the control of giant grasshoppers forcing them to produce a product for them or else    when flik   a bone fide inventor   creates a time conserving apparatus that accidentally destroys the season s donation   he puts them all in risk   and is sent away so that he won t screw anything up with the pretense that he is searching for help to fight the grasshoppers    he runs into a group of   warrirors   who are   unbeknownst to him   a group of carnival bugs   and they agree to help under similar false pretenses    these bugs are an equally wonderful assortment to anything in   toy story     foppish walking stick slim   david hyde pierce     german caterpillar heimlich   joe ranft     quick tempered and insecure male ladybug francis   denis leary     pretentious praying mantis manny   jonathan harris     his assistant butterfly hypsy   madeliene kahn     spider rosie   bonnie hunt     and two fleas   tuck and roll   michael mcshane     who speak in undiscernable jibberish    the writers lightly touch on each bug s place in bug society and the malleability thereof while making a wisecracks at everything they can   and blowing the audience away with wild visual treats    grasshoppers jumping in unison seems like a menacing earthquake    a small bird becomes an ominous mortal threat   whose usual mild mannered squeal is a scream of death    the bug city is a modern day metropolis   complete with fireflies temping as traffic lights and a fly sitting on the curb   holding out a cup   with a sign lying next to him that says   kid tore off wings      and a rainstorm is like a giant flood   with each drop acting like a small bomb dropped at millions of miles per hour    around this   the pixar animators stage several large set pieces   like a resuce mission halfway through that is as wild and entertaining as anything this year   and a wonderfully exciting action piece at the end   a chase scene at night through the labyrinthine branches of a small thicket    meanwhile   each character gets the spotlight to be completely idisyncratic and interesting   something   antz   couldn t do   and by the end   over the end credits     a bug s life   pulls it s final punch   out clever ing   antz   with a series of incessantly hilarious faux bloopers that come just at the right time   when those who leave immeadiately after the final frame of a film have left   and you can brag that you were one of the elite who stayed and got the full money s worth of entertainment    still   it s no   toy story      that film   maybe above any animated film i ve ever seen   encompassed almost true perfection in story   character   and wit    it proved that it didn t need to brag about it s cutting edge technology to really soar   it s the least visually striking of the three computer animated films thus far   but is still the most satisfying     and created a perfect world of idiosyncratic delights and innocent fun    yet   a bug s life     as well as   antz     are still amazing films   and prove without doubt   that if you re gonna make a computer animated film   send it to the guys who created these three flicks   evne if they re not working under the same roof    
20,67, upon arriving at the theater during the opening credits   i took my seat and prepared myself for what appeared to be   hellraiser meets the crow      but as soon as kiefer sutherland began speaking the narrative monologue   describing   the strangers   and their reasons for contacting human beings   i was hooked    there was something especially compelling about the nature of his voice    i knew from the start that i was going to witness the actions of his character rather than the actor attempting the character    sutherland played the role as a true veteran    upon the completion of his monologue   the camera arrives on sutherland in such a fashion that you can only wonder how long alex proyas spent on cinematography    i would imagine   for a film of this caliber   that maximum hours of work were spent where they were needed the most    the film flowed beautifully    as i was being taken through the intricate regions of the   dark city     a clever plot began to unravel   to the point where the last time i had seen such clever plot twists were in   the usual suspects      not to mention a series of special effects that would make james cameron literally turn green with envy    but if you re not exactly the biggest sci fi fan   caveat emptor    get ready for the atmostpheric darkness of   12 monkeys   or   the crow   without the boredom or depression    the concept of the plot is as mindstretching as   12 monkeys   was   however   so be prepared and be sophisticated    and imagine a picture that finally does justice to the comic book gone feature film fad that hollywood has recently become abusive of    dark city simply puts   spawn   to shame    in fact   during the climax of the film i couldn t help but feel the strong presence of an   akira    esque explosion throughout the general feeling of the movie    so my initial predictions were wrong    this film is anything but the meloncholy of   hellraiser   parts one through five    i m never one to base a film entirly on special effects   so know that when i give dark city  it s actually because the film contained all of the neccessary ingredients to keep me entertained and awake from storyline to plot twists to camerawork to even   tsk   tsk   special effects    not since contact have i recieved such deep insight into the way the human mind operates and never this year have i been so blown away    the best film i ve seen all year   and easily one of the best i ve ever seen  
21,77, it s ironic that the best films in cinema history are invariably the original director s cut of the film    films such as aliens   the abyss   the wild bunch   blade runner   and terminator 2 are all prime examples of a filmmaker s integrity   later chopped up or mucked with by the studio    the advent of the dvd format has provided a more accessible way to get these original cuts to the public and provide to film freaks like myself the ability to become further enraptured by the extension of such classic films    the dvd release of the original international version of luc besson s 1995 masterpiece the professional   which is known as l   on around the world   is a prime example of how a good film can become an instant classic as a director s cut    for years   i have heard of an   international   version available only in laserdisc format   which has eluded me for years    i even bought a laserdisc player from my uncle don for 100 bucks just to watch certain directors  cuts   including l   on    but after countless searches in laserdisc stores   i could never find it    until now    the film follows the story of l   on   played by jean reno   a professional hit man for an italian mob crew run by danny aiello    he lives next door to a ferociously independent 12 year old girl named mathilda   played by then newcomer natalie portman   whose father is involved in drugs and crooked cops    one day   a crew of the cops   lead by gary oldman in an over the top performance   kills her entire family while mathilda is out buying groceries    taking pity on her   l   on hides her in his apartment when she returns to save her life    mathilda learns of l   on s hit man profession and decides to follow in l   on s footsteps as a   cleaner      she then falls in love with him and manages to reawaken emotions within l   on he has kept locked away as part of his profession    at this point   the differences in the american version and the international version really kick in    the international version contains an additional 24 minutes of footage that pertains directly to the relationship of l   on and mathilda   footage that american censors deemed   too explicit      i assume that american censors feel that defining character development is too much for american audiences to handle    the best part of this extra footage is that gives better understanding of both mathilda s and l   on s motivations pertaining to later actions involving oldman and his crew of bad cops    there s even a previously unseen cameo by the great french actor jean hugues anglade   star of queen margot   besson s la femme nikita   and killing zoe    with these additional scenes replaced   l   on and matilda s relationship brings you emotionally closer to the film and draws stronger bonds between the characters that were murky in the american version    the most ironic thing about the international version of the film is that with the inclusion of the missing scenes   the film becomes primarily a heavy   emotional drama punctuated with big action scenes at the beginning and the end of the film    the film betters reflects the serious drama of french cinema but is laced with pieces reflecting the brutality of american cinema    my advice to everyone out there is to throw away your copy of the professional   throw down twenty bucks   and pick up this newly restored cinematic masterpiece    director/writer   luc besson producer   luc besson   claude besson starring   jean reno   natalie portman   gary oldman   danny aiello  
22,60, trailing the success of brit humour in the movie industry with the likes of the semi dramatic the commitments and the nearly slapstick a fish called wanda   the full monty is one film which delivered the depth of the former and the humour magnitude of the latter    the film opens with a narrated documentary reel showing the improving economic and living standards of sheffield in the 60 s   then cut to the harsh reality of the present    sheffield has become some sort of a semi slum with the only visible increase in anything was the amount of layoffs from steel factories   a once flourishing industry    gaz   carlyle   spends most of his time in the worker s club   a sort of place where jobless people sit around to wait for job offers    he and his `plump  friend dave   addy   as well as their former foreman gerald   wilkinson   have been sitting around the club for months without any `call for duty     what seemingly was just a passing hard time for gaz suddenly transformed itself into desperation when he cannot afford the 700 pounds of child support money to his ex wife    suddenly finding himself facing the possiblity of losing custody of his son   he goes on to concoct an enterprising wild idea to get the money he desperately requires    dave and gerald too have problems of their own    on top of his lack of employment   dave is also faced with the paranoia of his wife leaving him because of his current financial state as well as his`plump  appearance while gerald have been cheating on his wife by not telling her of his layoff for as long as 6 months   leaving home for `work  when he was actually a long standing member of the worker s club    there we have it   people with real problems and a not so practical solution for them    gaz manages to get the support from them and sure enough they managed to get a few other poor jobless blokes to join in their gag   to perform a strip act at the local pub    in gaz s own words while looking at an add for a strip act featuring hunky `beautiful  men   `if women are willing to pay for this   they sure as well will pay for real men     the full monty is very simple in nature and not a trace ambitious at all    it is a small film which delves in the harsh reality of unemployment and the desperation it drives people to    it also is a very light movie to watch despite the theme it delves in because it has a lot of human factor going for it    never for once   was it trying to be manipulative at all   the full monty was true to itself all the way    while the hilarity level of this film soared unexpectedly high   audience will find that they are in no way being cheated of a laugh   something lacking in many comedy films   wannabes     from hollywood    other than carlyle   who acted as the psychotic begbie in trainspotting   the rest of the actors were definitely very new to me on screen    however   the acting presented in this film is more than satisfying    carlyle s work here is a stark contrast to his character in trainspotting   implying real acting skill and flexibility on screen    kudos to the people involved in this film   especially to director peter cattaneo for being able to put together an excellent film which is has so much potential in ending up as your just another striptease    already a critical and financial success for such a small film   the full monty is a humble film which deserves applause throughout    while titanic managed to feast the eyes and soul in an epic way   the full monty gives one the same satisfaction       in  half the time    
23,62, most sequels don t do what they re supposed to do like   toy story 2   does    far too many of them end up re hashing the original and adding very little    is it any wonder that most sequels fail to live up to their predecessors    thankfully     toy story 2   is a wonderful exception    i can t remember the last time i saw a sequel as consistently fun and inventive as this one    it s yet another sign that pixar   the acclaimed animation studio behind   toy story   and   a bug s life     is still at the top of its game    woody and buzz are back in the sequel to the 1995 hit   toy story     and things have changed a bit since the last one ended    woody   voiced by tom hanks   is preparing to leave with his owner andy for cowboy camp    in his absence   he has assigned buzz lightyear   tim allen     now comfortable in his role as a toy   to take charge    unfortunately   woody s trip is ruined when he is accidentally put into the family garage sale   and is stolen by an over zealous toy collector   wayne knight      off to save him are buzz and members of the old   toy gang     including mr   potato head   don rickles     rex the nervous dinosaur   wallace shawn     hamm the piggy bank   john ratzenberger     and slinky dog   jim varney      while in captivity   woody makes a startling discovery   he is actually part of a collection of toys based on a 1950 s children s show entitled   woody s roundup      he meets the show s other characters   which include jesse   joan cusack     his cowgirl sidekick   the wise old prospector   kelsey grammer     and bullseye   his trusty horse    they have all been anxiously awaiting woody s arrival   as once their set is completed   they will be sold to a japanese toy museum   and finally escape storage forever    this means woody now faces a difficult choice    with his friends coming to rescue him   does he go with them and spend a few more years with andy   or does he go to japan and be immortalized forever    as in the original film     toy story 2   contains first rate animation   and pixar studios has done a remarkable job improving on the impressive work they did there    reportedly   the film was originally slated for a direct to video release   but after seeing the improvements that had been made   disney rightly decided to release it into theaters    the film is well worth seeing on the big screen    the colors are bright   the textures sharp   and even the human characters look more   human      the animation is consistently seamless   with the action fast and furious and the facial expressions believable    there are so many impressive sequences that i d find it impossible to list them here   but i was particularly wowed by a scene where buzz and his cohorts must get across a busy intersection to get to al  s toy barn   the store owned by woody s captor    pixar s rendition of the family dog is also nicely done   with fur so realistic you almost feel you could reach out and touch it    the voice work is also perfectly complementary   and as with the first movie   does much to help further character development    tom hanks and tim allen again disappear into their roles as woody and buzz   making you forget who is doing the voice    it was woody and buzz up there   not tom and tim    all the cast members from the original reprise their roles   and each is excellent    several new voices have been added   with joan cusack   kelsey grammer   and wayne knight doing fine work       toy story 2   is strong in characterization   and is able to expand on what we saw in the first movie    woody faces difficult choices   while buzz is confronted with a new buzz who hasn t yet realized his status as a toy   forcing him to see what he used to be like    the new characters are also developed quite well   especially jesse   who narrates a sarah mclachlan aided flashback illustrating how she was loved   then forgotten by her owner    it may be computer animated   and it may have sappy music   but it s downright touching    the script   despite having a story and screenplay each credited to four different writers   is endlessly clever and inventive   especially considering that it s a sequel    the reason   toy story 2   works where other movie sequels fail is that it refuses to just capitalize on the original s success by re doing the same story and using the same characters    not this one    we get character change   new characters   and new issues brought up       toy story 2   is also remarkable for the way in which it keeps reinventing itself    there is always another clever idea waiting just around the corner here    the humor is sharp and witty   with something to amuse both kids and adults    there are funny asides to films such as   star wars   and   jurassic park     among others   new takes on classic toys like barbie and rock  em sock  em robots   and appearances from other pixar efforts   a bug s life   and the 1997 short   geri  s game         geri himself makes an appearance as a toy repairman who fixes woody s broken arm      the action is fast and furious   and the chases   in the street   in a toy store   in an elevator   on a baggage carousel   and in an airplane   keep getting bigger and better       toy story 2   never grows stagnant   because there is always something new to hold your interest    the more you pay attention to it   the more rewarding it is    it s rare to see a film like   toy story 2   come along   because it s the kind of film that s almost impossible to dislike    it s created purely to entertain   and though i enjoy a thought provoking drama as much as the next person   it s nice to see that films are still trying to do exactly what movies first tried to do   send us out with a smile    it s a fair bet that the whole family will have smiles on their collective faces after seeing   toy story 2     it s the rare sequel that manages to expand on   and live up to   the original    
24,80, the rocky horror picture show  special edition    1975    starring   tim curry and susan sarandon  cult films are never mainstream    the casual viewer of a cult film will look at it and be repulsed and confused   yelling out  what the hell is that        fans of these sorts of movies will be laughing at every other second at all the  hidden jokes  they missed the first time around while normal movie watchers will look at them like they re insane    the rocky horror picture show   recently re released in a  special edition  to video   is the mother of all cult films    period    like some other cult films   most notably little shop of horrors   the rocky horror picture show is a musical with a twisted edge to it    this movie begins out innocently enough  a couple get engaged at a friend s wedding and get a flat tire in the middle of the night while it s raining    they go to a castle to try to use the phone    little do they know that the castle is owned by dr   frank n   furter   a mad transexual transvestite scientist who has recently created a creature he will use for personal reasons    the acting is pretty good overall    tim curry   home alone 2   legend   is over the top as frank n   furter    it s interesting to see that this movie was one of future oscar winner susan sarandon s   dead man walking   first film  she plays janet   the girlfriend of brad majors    even the singer meatloaf is in it ! !  the songs are all very good yet twisted in their own way    a sampling of titles range from damn it   janet to touch a touch a touch a touch me    all the actors sing their songs with no dubbing from other actors  kind of a bad thing    barry bostwick   brad majors   tries to sing as does susan sarandon   but tim curry is clearly the most professional having extensive stage experience    meatloaf sings like meatloaf    the new special edition contains two original movie trailers of the film as well as two songs deleted from the original version    sadly   the songs are tacked after the credits  kind of defeats the purpose    if you want to see a different film   watch this one ! !  
25,49, do film critics have morals    are there any unwritten laws an ethical movie critic would or should follow    naturally we don t want to go into a film with any preconceived notions   which is pretty tough but something we all have to accomplish    secondly   and along the same line   we can t prejudge a film because of it s stars   director   etc   the difference    well   in the first one   we d go into a film thinking it s going to be dumb or it s going to be good   and that would affect our viewing   that movie sounds and looks dumb   so i m not expecting much      on the second hand   we re simply assuming it will be bad or good because of a personal   grudge   against the film company   it s made by disney    oh   it s just a merchandising ploy then     the actors   jim carrey s in it    it s gonna stink !     or the director   who    can t be that good      this is more of a biased viewpoint as opposed to a first impression viewpoint    make sense    ok   but what about comparing    isn t that kind of along the same lines    when we compare a certain actor or director or even composer s credibility in one film to another they were involved in   is that really fair    sure   in sequels you can expect and accept comparisons a lot more   but what about jackie brown   for example    is it fair for me to take the review and turn it into a comparison of pulp fiction   just because quentin tarantino directed and wrote the screenplay for both    i think it is   and i ll tell you why    a good critic should be able to view the film from the   average joe   or jane     viewpoint   while still taking into account the artistic integrity behind the film    sometimes that can be tough       the acting was superb   but i was bored   or   i loved it ! !  it was sooooo cheezy !    might be used to describe a film    these are contradictions   and a critic has to weigh both sides and come to a suitable balanced critique    but which is more important    and which is better    an extremely well shot and acted film that is boring   or a really amateurish film that you wanna go back to again and again    getting back to the point   my philosophy on comparing films being fair works because we re reflecting what the public wants to know anyway    every average person out there who s interested in this film is likely to ask   how does it compare to pulp fiction      and so   as a critic   i m already responsible to ask that same question    jackie brown stars pam grier   the   blaxploitation   heroine from the 1970 s   who is likely to make a big comeback thanks to her role as the title character    tarantino s pulp fiction is in big part responsible for john travolta s sudden revival in the movie industry   and with talks of an oscar nomination   the same is likely to happen for grier       we ve made it thru comparison #1 !   jackie is a 44 year old airline stewardess who brings in extra cash   and probably her main revenue   by smuggling large sums of money into the united states for ordell robbie   pulp fiction s samuel l   jackson and comparison #2      ordell is in the illegal firearms business and has enlisted the aid of louis gara   robert de niro     a bank robber who just got out of prison after serving four years   to help him accomplish a scheme worth a half  million dollars    trouble arises when jackie is stopped by atf agent ray nicolet   michael keaton   and taken into custody for possession of narcotics   as well as having more money than is allowed in an airport without being claimed    naturally this proves an obstacle to ordell s plans and   not as friendly intended as we d hope   he posts jackie s bail after she is put behind bars    the thing is   ordell is in this for no one more than himself   and as we learn from his previous actions   he s willing to kill anyone who stands in the way    jackie finds herself in a tight squeeze    ordell won t think twice about taking her out if she fails to help him as she s always done   yet at the same time   a compromise with the authorities would be in order if evidence against ordell was provided    it comes down to a simple question   would jackie rather face ordell or prison    what ensues is a rich and intriguing example of storytelling as we question who jackie is really out to help   the law   ordell   or maybe just herself    coming into play is another 70 s veteran   robert forster as jackie s bail bondsmen max cherry    max s obvious fondness for jackie will become a major benefactor in her fight to beat both sides of the system   and forster plays him with subtle charm that adds depth to unbrewed romance    also involved is ordell s   surfer girl   girlfriend melanie   bridget fonda     a ditzy sun  bleached babe who spends her time watching tv with a bong in hand    fonda does the best she can with an essentially thin role   but there s nothing more to her   and therefore   she becomes a tossable addition to an otherwise flourishing bouquet of characters    de niro is also wasted in his role as a quiet nobody crook out to score a few bucks for himself    de niro is a brilliant actor   but a character who hardly ever speaks doesn t need a de niro to play him    compared to pulp fiction   comparison #3     the characters in jackie brown and very thin and replaceable    in pulp fiction   even the small   seemingly irrelevant characters were wonderful   complete   and lifelike   whereas jackie brown has such common figures that it wouldn t have suffered much with a lesser talented cast   the exception being grier    tarantino wrote this script with grier specifically in mind   so to say that she is made for this role is a reversed truth    sadly   grier too could have received a bit more attention   especially when the story is all about her newly jarred perception of life    jackson teams up with tarantino again   but the chemical reaction isn t as awesome as the first time    jules was the rambling   bible quoting hitman in pulp fiction   and jackson is the only person who could have pulled it off    and although jackson is really   really good in jackie brown   i don t think he s quite as irreplaceable    in fact   maybe a new face would have been better    jackson could ve remained tarantino s jules   and a new guy could have become ordell   forever to remain so in our memories    sadly   these characters are too much the same   except ordell just isn t as impressive   and putting this in the hands of jackson once again is only going to deter from our fond recollections of jules    another problem is that ordell is way too focused on in the beginning    this is grier s film   so why spend so long getting to know a man who will become more of a supporting character as the film progresses    it not only makes the movie feel a little too slanted   but it makes for a slow beginning because we have to take longer getting to the meat of the story    it is likely that those pouring into the theater to see this film are going to be those anxious to partake of tarantino s quirky dialogue and eccentric directing style   and not so much those interested in seeing a silver screen adaption of elmore leonard s novel   rum punch      for those movie goers   don t expect another pulp fiction and you ll be satisfied   for the script oozes with the familiar brash qualities that has made tarantino an icon of 90 s film  making    the directing has toned down a bit   however   yet we re still reminded that this is tarantino s movie thanks to odd split screen story telling devices and scenes being replayed multiple times from different viewpoints    so getting back to the question that i began with   this isn t pulp fiction at all    it s good   but it isn t anything that made pulp fiction such a revolutionary effort in the first place    this is a more conservative tarantino   but not one that won t satiate true fans    if you can realize that this isn t going to knock your socks off   then you ll be happy to at least let it massage your feet    after all   we all know how much tarantino loves that particular part of the human anatomy

28,26, one sided   doom and gloom   documentary about the possible annihilation of the human race as foretold by the bible    orson welles narrates and appears in the film in which he   along with best selling author hal lindsey   discusses various prophecies from the bible and relates them to recent   well for 1976 anyway   events    the film is dated badly   as many things that are supposed to happen in the   future   never do    for example   the planets of the solar system were supposed to line up in the year 1982 and cause chaos here on earth    we re still here    the arms race between the soviets and america was supposed to kick off the apocalypse    we re still here    some of the more ludicrous moments come when it s alluded to that people like jimmy carter and henry kissinger may actually be the antichrist   !      also   there s ten minutes of stock footage at the end of the film meant to give us an idea of what the battle for armageddon might be like    if it s anything like it s depicted as here then it s going to be incredibly boring    the late great planet earth is available on dvd from vci home video    it contains the film in standard form   aspect ratio of 1   33   1     although some moments of stock footage are letterboxed    also included are brief bios on orson welles and hal lindsey   as well as a trailer for another recent vci home video release   chariots of the gods    audio is mono dolby digital   and the video is fair to good for a film like this    i believe this is the first appearance of this film on any home video format so any condition at all is fine with me    certainly i never expected a remastered print    curiously   the menu screens on this dvd look nothing like the menu screens pictured on the back of the case    but they re menu screens        so who really cares    [pg]  
29,35, when it comes to the average teenage romantic comedy   i expect negative reviews from critics left and right    predictable   unoriginal   and forgettable will most likely be the three adjectives to haunt the down to you s and the drive me crazy s released by the dozens these last couple of years    what i really look for in this kind of movie is the entertainment value while i m sitting in the theater    am i enjoying myself    is this a comfortable break from my week of finals    this is why i have given films like final destination or road trip high marks   i had a party of a time wasting my money on something i won t remember next week    so last week i opened up the new york times   and   no surprise   boys and girls got a negative review    daily news    negative    reelviews    negative    epinions   com    negative    this was nothing new    american pie   final destination   road trip didn t get such hot reviews and i loved those guilty pleasures    same goes for she s all that   a formulaic but enjoyable pygmalion adaptation that got unjustly pounded    since boys and girls reunites she s all that director robert iscove and actor freddie prinze jr     i predicted d   j   vu al over again    but   still curious   i asked around my school and from the one or two people who had seen it   the reactions were far from positive    i had made up my mind   i ll catch it on video or cable in a couple of years    but   soon after   following a series of unexpected events   we couldn t get into shaft because it is rated r     i found myself watching boys and girls    whoops    boys and girls is about a   nerdy   smart   boy named ryan   prinze jr     and a   popular   flirt   girl named jennifer   claire forlani      briefly meeting as pre teens and now attending the same college   the two bump into each other so many times that eventually they become best friends    but in the movies   a male and a female cannot be friends without having that nagging feeling of attraction for each other    with advice from their roommates   amanda detmer   jason biggs     ryan and jennifer attempt to discover the true meaning of their relationship    the film definitely lives up to the dreaded three adjectives   and mindless entertainment is nowhere to be found    i could hardly sit through the 93 minute running time for several reasons    the dialogue is probably the worst i have ever seen in any movie   mainly because the whole movie depends on the boring script and the ridiculous words these characters use is what hollywood thinks kids can relate to    it is almost offensive    an example of an insightful conversation       you re dumb    dumb   dumb   dumb   dumb         no         followed by a mandy moore esque tune background       well it s not as bad as wing commander i guess    the supporting cast is also painfully useless    detmer and biggs stand in the way for anything interesting to happen with their own boring   pointless subplots    and although this is supposed to be from both perspectives of the human sex   prinze jr s ryan dominates the screen while forlani s jennifer simply acts as a dilemma for him to work with    we never learn anything about jennifer which is a shame too because forlani is the only actor to bring any life into her character    teenager or not   you ll hate this movie   i guarantee it    maybe i should rent she s all that again    is it really as good as i think it is    
30,38, mr   nice guy is the latest jackie chan film   so you should know what to expect    a weak plot   terrible dialogue   very little acting ability   but some jaw dropping action sequences that nearly make the rest of it worthwhile    however   mr   nice guy lacks the sparkle of jackie s best efforts   and its weaknesses are more glaring than ever    jackie chan plays   who else   jackie    this time out   he s a famous chef who hosts an australian cooking show    not that it ever makes a difference in the plot    there are only two scenes of him cooking    for the rest of the film   somehow he mutates into jackie chan   supercop    it never does explain why his character has such superb martial arts skills       perhaps he was in the same cooking class as steven seagal in under siege    a tv newswoman   diana   gabrielle fitzpatrick     covertly tapes a drug deal involving kingpin giancarlo   richard norton   and a local gang of toughs   the demons    although she only has one camcorder   somehow the result is full of close ups and multiple angles       hmmm    shades of broadcast news        anyway   the goons discover diana   and will do anything to recover the tape    here lies another crucial flaw in the story   doesn t anyone realize you can copy a tape    oh well   no one ever said jackie chan movies had to make sense    as luck would have it   diana runs across jackie   and   wouldn t you know it   jackie accidentally ends up with the tape    this leads to countless chase and/or fight scenes which look like they could have been lifted from rumble in the bronx or nearly any other jackie chan movie    in a move apparently designed to woo american   and other english speaking   audiences   the film uses english as its primary language    however   that doesn t mean an end to the atrocious dubbing that has afflicted jackie s recent americanized releases    strangely   many of the characters speaking english are overdubbed with english   and poorly too    whether this is just a very bad case of looping   an effort to minimize accents   or a simple case of nostalgia   it does achieve the same level of distraction present in all of jackie s dubbed films    the plot in mr   nice guy is negligible   merely an excuse to have jackie on the run from various goons    but even though plots have always been second to the action in jackie s films   it seems odd that the filmmakers have stuck us with this tired retread    look   if you have jackie chan playing a chef   why not use that to your advantage    watching jackie doing his stuff in a kitchen   beating the bad guys with foodstuffs sounds like the perfect setup for innumerable comic stunts    the action is a mixed bag here    there s really only one no holds barred fight scenes that have become the trademark of jackie s films    it takes place in the arbitrary location of a construction site   apparently for the sole reason that there are lots of nifty things lying around that can be useful ala jackie chan    the action in the film is neither jackie s best nor worst   but you long for some more inspiration in the scenes    the film s gratuitous use of slow motion is distracting    once or twice   it may be useful to highlight a spectacular stunt sequence    but to slo mo jackie running    either this is a nod to the six million dollar man   or a pathetic attempt to disguise the fact that jackie may be slowing down    if you ve seen all of jackie s films and are in need of another fix   go ahead and see mr   nice guy    however   if you re just in the mood for some good action   you d be better off hitting the video store for some of his better work   such as supercop    
31,37, lucas was wise to start his star wars trilogy with episode 4   episode 1 is a boring   empty spectacle that features some nice special effects    after the familiar  a long time ago            opening   the film starts with the opening yellow crawl that features in every star wars movie and computer game    the plot is that the trade confederation are blocking off supplies to the peaceful planet of naboo   ruled by queen amidala   portman   jedi knights qui gon   neeson   and obi wan   mcgregor   are sent to negotiate a deal with the confederation to stop the blockade    however   this simple blockade is not all it seems   and the jedi knights soon have to deal with many more dangers   including facing the evil darth maul   ray park      they also meet the future darth vadar   anakin skywalker   jake lloyd    star wars is largely a failure in all the major areas of filmmaking   script   direction and characters    the script desperately tries to make an thin and boring story into a two hour epic    the trade confederation plot is just not as exciting as the death star   and as the film goes on the drama becomes more and more non existent    there s no underlying tension   and no urgent need to see what the outcome is    the film also takes a leisurely pace in telling the boring story   which doesn t help    there s no snap to make the film work   it moves at a plod    the script is boring   all the characters speak in morals   especially anakins mother    there s no group spirit evident here   and when all characters can speak only in profound statements or bark orders   it s evident that not much is going to happen    the two leads are hideously boring   static characters given little to do and too much time to do it    qui gon and obi wan hold no presence on film   and give little for the audience to root for    the audience will probably warm more to bad guy darth maul   if he had been given more screen time    maul is one of the most underused bad guys in film history   even if he does provide the only  straight  plot line in the film   all the other plots in this film are to be concluded throughout the trilogy      anakin is annoying and unlikeable      instead of cute and huggable as lucas no doubt intended    it s probably not surprising that his hateful little boy   unfortunately blessed  ani  by everyone he knows   joins the dark side and kills everyone as quickly as possible    the comedy relief is supposedly provided by the gangly jar jar brinks   although in the end none is provided in the film by him    although his floppy features will no doubt be great for stuffed toys   the lines and actions he is given are painfully unfunny    the only good laugh is when his tongue is burned by a  pod  racer   because i knew he wouldn t be able to talk for a while    queen amidala is a nothing in the film   she serves no real purpose apart from the fact that she must  serve her people     and go goo goo over anakin    again   her role will become more important in the later episodes   and is given little to do here    the actors don t help the movie much either    liam neeson seems bored and embarrassed   and seems desperate to leave the movie as quickly as possible    mcgregor comes across as a posh mothers boy   with little charm    the casting director must have chose him because he s scottish like alec guinness   there s little other explanation for it    natalie portman is plagued by hideous costumes and a poor script   but she delivers a spunky performance    and jake lloyd looks at everyone with hateful eyes and delivers his lines in a bored voice    there s very little talent evident with him   it s hard to see why lucas chose him when there are better child actors out there    he s not even very  cute      the main claim of the film   the special effects   are okay    there s nothing impressive about them   yet they complement the story well    the cgi takes away much of the human element   however    the battle droids for example   the replacement for the stormtroopers   are characterless little computer graphics   lacking the humour and humanness that came from the stormtroopers    episode 1 is just disappointing    it s got high production values   but little else    the music is meandering   except near the end    the plot gives us no one to root for   or even care for    the effects are nice   but dull    the plot goes on for half an hour longer than it should    there s an air of manufacturing among the whole sorry affair   and many clich   s are catered for throughout the film    apart from a remotely exciting pod race sequence   episode 1 is a dry affair that serves little purpose   except to make money and to get us to watch episode 2 to see what happens to the many unfinished plot lines in the film    disappointing is barely the word    rating=

36,22, capsule   the much anticipated re adaptation of the pierre boulle novel comes to the screen as a dark and a little dreary film with lots of chases and fighting   but very little intelligence    visually there is much to like about this version   but the approach is to take an adventure after the style of gulliver s travels and treat it as an action film    that makes it a film without much center       0    4 to +4    pierre boulle   author of the bridge on the river kwai   wrote planet of the apes   a   k   a   monkey planet     the novel   as a social satire    it reads a lot like a fifth book of gulliver s travels    humans discover a planet in which the roles of apes and humans have been reversed   not unlike the roles of horses and humans on jonathan swift s island of the houyhnhnms    the novel moves somewhat slowly to create some suspense in revealing all the things most film fans know to be true about the nature of the planet    it seems to me there is also a statement about human cruelty to animals   but perhaps i was just looking for that    when rod serling adapted the novel into a film released in 1968   he added a number of serling touches   familiar from episodes of the twilight zone and changed the ending to make it more serling ish    the final irony of the original version has become film history    without it there could never have been a   planet of the apes   film series    i can surmise only that serling ran into serious script problems in how to handle the tricky question of language    in the book the apes had their own language and the human eventually learned that language    that could have been done in the film   but that would have required the entire film to be subtitled for the non ape speaking    serling avoided this by having the apes speak english and   of course   there is some justification for that by the end of the film    justifying why the apes spoke english may have even been the inspiration for his surprise ending    but serling never tackles the all important question of why a supposedly intelligent human never shows any curiosity or even surprise that the apes speak his own language   a language they had no opportunity to ever hear    few viewers questioned this serious plot hole   however   and the film has become well respected in cinema history    partial credit at least should go to jerry goldsmith whose extremely inventive score is one of goldsmith s best if not his best    when the film s success called for sequels   the filmmakers turned up the violence and they added well intentioned   though not very subtle   political messages about what was happening in the united states of the 1960s and 1970s    while the first film had a little shooting of guns and what was there seemed a little half  hearted   by the second film   beneath the planet of the apes   there was a good deal more violence and from that point on the series had a lot of violence and chases    the series concluded with battle for the planet of the apes in 1973    now director tim burton tries his hand at adapting the original book again    for those who thought that the 1968 version was not very faithful to the book   burton s new version is even less faithful    first   he does not really reverse the roles of the humans and the apes    he has them both be intelligent   articulate races battling for a dominance of the planet currently in the hands   uh   make that paws   of the apes    that could be a good story too   but it is not planet of the apes    as with the mission impossible films and so many other cinematic homages to the third quarter of the last century   the title makes promises that the filmmakers have no intention of honoring    in 2029 leo davidson   mark wahlberg   not this world s most expressive actor   works on a space station increasing the intelligence and usefulness of apes    then a convenient time storm sweeps him up wizard of oz fashion and drops him on an alien planet       yes   he survives this storm   but then no storm is perfect      he quickly finds   not greatly to any surprise he shows   that on this planet apes rule and humans drool   but everybody talks    and the language they talk is earth  english    apparently it does not even occur to leo that there is a mystery that needs to be explained about that    the fact it does not occur to leo and apparently didn t occur to tim burton either is the heart of the real horror of this film    both just assumed that if apes were going to talk the language they would speak would be english    in any case having one talking race dominating another makes this not a look at human animal relationships and more one of the master slave relationships    outside of sudan and a few other countries this is a less relevant topic    leo is captured to be used as a slave but also is discovered by ari   played by helena bonham carter    ari is an attractive ape with close ties to high political power    she is bent on making the world a better place    perhaps in a previous draft of the script she was called hil ari    in any case with makeup that stifles her usual pout   carter is just about as attractive as she has ever been in a film    she may want to consider this to become her standard look from this point forward    it is not long before leo escapes with some human and only a couple of sympathetic apes    this is a further abandonment of the source material    the chase severely limits the interplay of ape and human and the examination of each s place in this reversed society   each important in the book    we cannot see how the society works because most of the screentime society has broken down    we see the humans either separated from the apes or fighting them    burton chooses visceral thrills over cerebral ones at almost every turn    this is a miscalculation   as characters so lacking in empathy value are difficult ones to place much emotional investment in    they are basically chess pieces and the viewer has little reason to root for them to win    the 1968 script had little subtlety   with lines like   i never met an ape i didn t like     but at least we cared for what happened to taylor   the main character    most of what this film has to offer is in the visuals    the visual work is spotty but generally nicely done except that so much of the film takes place in the night or in fog    this tends to limit close looks at the makeup    in general it seems much improved from 1968    the makeup team is led by rick baker instead of john chambers   who did it for the 1968 version    in 1968 chambers makeup was a jaw dropper    it was realistic enough to almost be believable but flexible enough to show emotion    chambers is good   but if anyone had a chance to best him it would have to be baker    today audiences have higher expectations   baker s visualization is really an improvement    these visuals work nicely    what does not work is the wire  assisted leaps some of the apes make    they look like they were inspired by the physics  defying leaps of crouching tiger   hidden dragon    apes spring incredible distances    some of the best scenes are apes running into battle looking like they have ape posture   but when they start flying through the air the effect is lost    one final visual problem is that the film frequently shows its budget in what should be spectacular battle scenes the camera shows us only a small group of people close up    since the days of lon chaney and boris karloff few actors have crossed over to stardom in a role that required heavy make up    the one actor who has a shot is paul giamatti    it is not that his lines are so good   most are silly jokes    but he delivers them very well    he was always a watchable actor   but has not yet made stardom    as the ape trader limbo he over emotes to overcome his ape make up   but does it very well    in doing so he makes himself the most interesting thing on the screen    he is probably the best thing in the film and conjures up memories of peter ustinov s performance in spartacus    as an in joke there are several lines in the script borrowed from the 1968 film and an old ape played by charleton heston becomes an allusion to the first film by itself    danny elfman s score has a nice primitive feel   but jerry goldsmith s 1968 tour de force score is a real classic    that score and the whole film will be remembered when the 2001 film is forgotten    i rate the remake 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the  4 to +4 scale

 and there s some scenes like those you d expect to find in a movie   and there s some action        and there s other        stuff        too    how to immediately grab my attention   open your movie with five dead guys in santa claus suits    then show a caption reading   six days earlier          ya know   i was honestly interested to find out what killed all those poor santas        how to immediately lose my attention   follow your opening scene with a terminally dull nice guys who don t deserve to be in prison scene    write a line for the one of prisoners like   i just want to go home and eat christmas dinner and watch some ball with my dad      then   have ben affleck actually say that line   on film   and forget to leave it on the cutting room floor    for good measure   throw in a poorly motivated prison riot and have affleck s best buddy stabbed        aw        and just two days before his release   too    already the cliches are piled on thick   and when it rains   it pours    how to take my attention   dash it violently against the rocks   and make it so that i m contemplating my strategy for calling   shotgun   about an hour before i know the credits will roll   deny your characters the ability to think    have ben affleck   for some reason i ll never understand   pretend he s his dead prison buddy so that he can get his girlfriend   played by charlize theron    have gary sinise show up and force the two of them to participate in a poorly planned casino heist    the villains  big idea    kidnap affleck because he used to be a security guard at the casino   force him to tell you where all the doors in the place are   then dress up in santa suits   create some   diversions   and rob the place    on paper   it seems like the stuff of a potential caper comedy   but veteran director john frankenheimer wrongly picks up that piece of paper and thinks he s looking at the makings for some sort of clever action crime thriller    it s not like the man isn t capable        far from it    he s the man responsible for classic political thrillers like the manchurian candidate and seven days in may    he wowed me with some the most memorable car chases i ve ever seen in last year s ronin    but he s certainly guilty of churning out some certifiable losers        put reindeer games on the shelf of shame with his 1996 version of the island of dr   moreau    step one in making your movie as easily forgotten as possible   cast ben affleck in the role of the world s most generic hero    he gets no good one liners   he doesn t get to shoot or implode anything in new and interesting ways   and all we know about him is that he regrets his past as a car thief and wants a cup of hot chocolate and piece of pecan pie    his name is rudy   short for rudolph   in all likelihood    see   it s called reindeer games    get it    get it    shut up      in the past   affleck has been at his best as a supporting actor   and reindeer games does nothing to further his viability as a leading man    step two in making your movie as easily forgotten as possible   gary sinise s villain dresses and looks like the most standard movie crook a filmmaker could have some up with    he s dirty and potty mouthed   he s got long   scruffy hair and a goatee   and i fully expected him to walk out of the casino carrying sacks with giant dollar signs on them    he s also extremely inept at what he does    he thinks garish cowboy costumes and santa suits make acceptable disguises   and he trusts affleck s character to pull through even after   time and time and time again   he tricks him and lies to him and nearly kills him    but instead of tapping into the comic possibilities of this role   sinise seems to think he s playing some sort of tough   smart   and smooth criminal mastermind   rather than the complete moron that was obviously written into the script    [on a side note   gary sinise wins this week s   title !    award   as he s the one who gets to awkwardly cram the name of the movie into one of his lines early in the proceedings    last week s winner was natasha henstridge for the whole nine yards   ]  how to take your bad idea and make things worse   include two or three plot twists that   instead of making the apparently stupidity of the plan seem suddenly intelligent   make the plan seem even more ridiculous and unlikely    this is a bad movie    and what s worse is that   except for a few moments near the not so stunning conclusion as the preposterous is replaced by the ludicrously preposterous   reindeer games never really gives us the satisfaction of being laughably bad    if they d done that much   at least i would have been entertained    
40,37, you know that a movie has issues when most everyone in the audience comes out laughing       and  it s not a comedy !  and what a strange career path for director chuck russell    he starts his career off with a decent take on the   nightmare on elm street   series with his debut as director on installment number three    he follows that up with the blob the very next year   but waits another six years to do his next piece   a little film called the mask starring jim carrey   and then one more star vehicle in eraser two years after that    so then he thought     let me wait another five years   get a weak script jammed with cliches and hope that jimmy smits and kim basinger could pull it out of its ashes     !    strange dude and one crappy flick    plot   a six year old girl is believed to be some kind of mysterious prophet sent down from god    a satanic cult wants the girl to switch over to their side   while the girl s aunt wants to       well    save her from those damn devil worshippers !  enter one occult expert agent   plenty of bobo cops and lots of nuns praying   and you ve just about got the gist of things here    critique   with plot holes the size of my ass   this movie barely squeezes any sense out of its clich    ridden plot   with wasted talent   cheezy effects   bad dialogue and unintentional laughs to boot    what s good about this movie    well   rufus sewell is pretty fun to watch as the head of a creepy runaway children s shelter/satanist supreme   with seriously wicked eyes and just enough ham in his performance to go with all of the cheese lying around    the little girl is also pretty good but unfortunately her character doesn t really do all that much    and believe it or not   i was actually enjoying some of the film s first half hour   which starts off with some promise   but not before bonehead moves after bonehead moves from our protagonist   basinger   just drown the film s entire basis of believability    for some reason   it takes her more time than anyone to figure out that her niece is gifted   and even longer to figure out that every move that she makes       is  a dumb one !  add that to the entire police force of incompetents   save for jimmy smits   whose talent agent advised him that playing the exact same cop character from nypd blue would be a good career move    at least change the clothes   jimmy !     zero scares   zero thrills and even less actual drama   and you ve got yourself a pretty bad movie    and why would respected actors like christina ricci and ian holm take bit parts in this movie    did they owe the director a favor or something    together   they barely have five minutes of screen time   but i suppose that ricci s hospital room scene might be worth a look for some of you horn dogs    the worst part about this movie is its hilariously unbelievable ending   which features police officers coming up with the brilliant idea of   sneaking up   on a man s house   who they know to be guilty of a crime !  uuuhmm       how s  about knocking on the door and arresting his sorry ass   officers   !  anyway   i don t usually inscribe spoilers in my reviews but the stupidity of some of these characters is just too difficult to describe without validating it with solid idiotic proof   and there was plenty to go around      and did basinger lose some of her acting   talent   during her hiatus from the profession after her 1997 oscar win    difficult to say if it was her lines that were really bad   or if she just delivered them poorly    either way   little originality   very obvious computer effects   little thrills   little drama and very little entertainment value   certainly bestow the honor of one of the worst movies of the summer upon this film    but if you really don t mind a rehashed gobbledygook of various satanic and   kid    based thrillers   and enjoy watching films that don t bring anything new to the table       well    drink some beers   smoke some beans and rent this video   because it may just be one of the funnier thrillers of the year    
41,39, capsule   dumb dud of an entry in the body heat sweepstakes   and now something of a landmark for having spawned a jillion clones    basic instinct s worst crime is that it s not just a bad movie   but in many ways   an incompetent one as well    it s stupid in itself   and stupid to think its audience is as stupid as it is    it s supposed to be a thriller   but the plot is dead on its feet   and ultimately arbitrary   it s only put into the movie to jerk us around    it s also supposed to be sexy   but it s instead got the unpleasant rawness of a teenager showing younger kids his collections of dirty pictures    it s a ripoff    the story opens with a rock star being murdered while in the throes of orgasm    the biggest suspect is an authoress   catherine tramell   sharon stone     who wrote a novel in which the murder was eerily presaged    or maybe it s the work of a copycat    these and other plot threads get fed to the detective who s on the case   michael douglas     who has a few problems himself    like we wonder if his elevator goes to the top floor    we can measure with a stopwatch the time from them setting eyes on each other to the moment they are doing the mattress dance    joe eszterhas has written the screenplay   and he uses a device that he used before in the much better jagged edge   the killer s identity is kept a secret until the movie s final shot    this isn t in itself a problem    the problem is that up until that point   we ve been given nothing to work with    every clue in the movie    every clue    is ambiguous    the whole thriller aspect of the movie is a shill    red herrings   dead plot threads   violence   and kinky sexuality litter the movie like potholes in manhattan streets    they add up to zip   because they re not happening to people we care about    douglas s character is foulmouthed and bitter and that s it   stone s character has an iron on smile that never changes   the rest are forgettable    when we don t even have the luxury of giving a damn about anyone in the movie   who cares what happens in it    especially with an ending that is not only unsatisfying   but in many ways inexplicable       a friend of mine once came up with a rule of thumb about movie characters     if no one in the movie behaves like anyone you know   or would * care * to know   just leave !      one of the nastier things about the movie is the way it treats lesbianism not as an integral part of someone s life   but as a kind of kink    something to thrill men with    i despair whenever i encounter this kind of stupidity in mainstream entertainment   are we still so culturally neanderthal that the only way to include something like that in a big budget hollywood film is as a hefnerism    
42,34, in the interest of being generous   i want to start this review with the scene that i liked in meet joe black    sir anthony hopkins   playing a super rich media mogul   has gathered his family around him for dinner    his oldest daughter   played by marcia gay harden from millers crossing     who has been obsessively planning his sinfully extravagant birthday party   presents him with three superbly decorated little cakes   which are supposed to be scale models for his big birthday cake    the daughter asks hopkins to pick the one he likes    hopkins   frustrated by the weight of planning for the whole elaborate affair   does what any man in his position would do   he punts    whichever one you like   dear   he says    and the daughter does exactly what any woman in her position would do   she cries    i liked that scene for two reasons    first   the cakes looked really cool    second   it was   perhaps   the only scene in the movie where people acted as you would expect people to act    meet joe black is chock full of odd performances   people doing things for no discernible reason at all   and doing them in slow motion over the course of three hours to boot    it s easy to watch meet joe black for the abundant eye candy of the palatial homes and the beauteous claire forlani   but it s even easier to sleep right through it   two people on my row managed it quite nicely      the difficult part of the movie is understanding the characters and their motivations and why someone thought three hours was an appropriate length for this overwrought mess    i know my audience had problems with the movie   because they thought it was a comedy    case in point   everyone should know by now that brad pitt plays the angel of death in this movie    however   the first we see of him is as a young lawyer in a coffee shop hitting on the glamorous claire forlani       it s not clear from the movie whether you need a law degree to become the angel of death   but it makes a certain kind of sense      it shouldn t take long for the observant moviegoer to realize that bad things are about to happen to mr   pitt    and indeed they do   after a hideously prolonged sequence where pitt looks over his shoulder at the retreating forlani and forlani looks over her shoulder at the retreating pitt     because pitt walks into the road without looking and suddenly gets squished    well   when that happened   the audience howled with laughter   and continued to laugh at every comment that was remotely humorous    so   if you think that sudden violent death and sarcastic drawing room humor are funny   i encourage you to go see meet joe black immediately    anyway   the deceased lawyer s body   no worse the wear from its massive injuries   is possessed by the angel of death and brad pitt takes over that role    the idea is that death   given the pen name of joe black   so as not to disturb others   wants to take a holiday and experience the world    if this weren t hollywood   we might get an interesting metaphysical discussion of life and death   but since it is   we get scene after scene of fish out of water humor   just as if death is george of the jungle or crocodile dundee or some other poor schmuck who s wandered in from the jungle or the outback or whatever and doesn t know how to act in our society    it also doesn t help that the character of death is written so inconsistently    he claims to be on vacation   but he never does anything except hang around the seriously attractive claire forlani   just try to get your travel agent to book that one      he speaks very slow and halting english but perfectly fluent jamaican patois    he knows everything about some characters   nothing about others    and as played by brad pitt   he s not especially menacing or charming or glamorous or intriguing   he s just there    it s as if someone told pitt     never mind about acting in this picture   son   just stand there and look pretty      it s as if pitt is doing his keanu reeves impression throughout the movie    i ve used the phrase   angel of death   in this review very deliberately to contrast pitt s performance with this year s best angel performance   nicolas cage s in city of angels    where pitt is cold and unfeeling   cage is as warm and empathetic as the situation allows    where cage is genuinely curious about the nature of man   pitt is aloof and arrogant    cage struck instant chemical sparks with co star meg ryan   where the chemistry between pitt and forlani is only understandable if you accept the notion that forlani s character is so shallow that she can t see beyond pitt s good looks    the movie s other top name is a much better actor   but that doesn t save meet joe black    sir anthony hopkins isn t given much better material to work with   unfortunately    he plays one of these good hearted multimillionaire media moguls that only exist in hollywood       one wonders what might have happened if they had made hopkins s character more realistically evil      hopkins is marked for death due to a bad ticker   but death steps in and grants him some extra time in exchange for being his guide in the world    of course   no one can be sure of how they will act when death taps on their shoulder    but i have to wonder   and in this movie   you have a very long time to wonder   how you or i would act in a similar situation   especially if you or i were a multimillionaire    hopkins pretty much goes to the office    and the major subplot revolves around who will control the corporation    fans of corporate intrigue will be fascinated   i m sure    i stayed awake all the way through meet joe black   and i m asking myself why    movies about death should encourage you to live life to the fullest   which is what i m going to do now    go spend time with your family   go volunteer for a local charity   heck   go take a nap    don t go see meet joe black   because all it will do is move you three long hours closer to death       curtis edmonds     no children have ever meddled with the republican party and lived to tell about it

43,44, retelling the classic story of joan of arc has been a popular trend this year    earlier this may   leelee sobieski played the passionate title role in the top rated miniseries that debuted on cbs    and now   director luc besson has delivered his version of the sweeping epic about the teenage girl supposedly sent by god to rescue france from the clutches of their enemies    starring milla jovovich   who is predominantly unconvincing as the heavenly messenger accused of being a witch   `the messenger   the story of joan of arc  is a disjointed and overblown historical re enactment that prevails merely as a bloated mistreatment of the famous legend    besson   who s previous work includes the hyperactive sci fi `the fifth element    perhaps entrusted a bit too much faith in ex wife jovovich   because in `the messenger    the actress is drowning in a pool of her own inexperience    at first   when reports were indicating that jovovich had been chosen for such a demanding role   i was highly doubtful that her marginal talent could carry a film of such a caliber    after seeing the rousing trailer   my hesitant optimism suddenly skyrocketed   milla jovovich looked superb    with the hopeful propulsion of her stellar performance   `the messenger  looked like a timeless epic in the making    a timeless epic it is not    besson is hesitant to abandon his unique and flashy style   and the story behind `the messenger  is not entirely suited to his demands    on the shoulders of besson s choppy and unexciting direction   the film dissipates into an uninspiring hodgepodge of poorly executed battle sequences and bizarre imagery    there is no human exploration into the character of joan   or jeanne      jovovich merely rambles on about the power of god when we have little or no insight into her visionary objective    jovivich s unsatisfying portrayal only helps lead to the realization that besson sees jeanne as a piece of spiritual cardboard    she is just another special effect in this continuous visual feast    jovovich does have a few isolated moments of sheer power   but mainly   she looks lost    quite frankly   i don t know of any actress who could successfully navigate her way through `the messenger  without a major fumble    the script is chock full of laughable dialogue and unfortunate comedy   as jeanne confronts the uncrowned king charles vii   john malkovich   and informs him of her heavenly intentions    faye dunaway plays charles  overbearing mother in law   and dustin hoffman appears over two hours into the story as a character dubbed   the conscience     all three actors juggle limited screen time   although malkovich is uncharacteristically awful    the battle scenes are extremely bloody   but with the presence of such jittery camera work   they capture none of the excitement or finesse of something like `braveheart     there s a particularly graphic and unsettling scene early on   when jeanne   as a young girl   watches in horror from a closet as her older sister is murdered and then savagely raped by a bloodthirsty english soldier    even his fellow troopers are petrified    `the messenger  is also strictly a 90 s update on the classic story    almost too 90 s   it seems    there s gratuitous use of the f word and a barrage of slang terms like `she s nuts !    sprinkled throughout the screenplay    i was half expecting jeanne to invite her homeys to come chill in her crib   but it never happened    there s also the familiar presence of bizarre besson humor   but none of it comes even remotely close to functioning properly    it seems terribly misplaced   but in a catastrophe as jumbled and disjointed as `the messenger    almost everything does    the musical score by erric serra is spectacular   and the set and production designs are continuously impressive    if it was visual excellence that besson was striving for   then he achieves his goal    but the only time the dramatics come alive in `the messenger  is during the closing trial   in which jeanne is found guilty and burned at the stake    during these moments   the historical relevance and dramatic purpose of joan of arc reaches the audience   albeit in a faint stream of light that provokes little power or meaning    it s just too delayed for besson to revive his lifeless interpretation   in which he is always concerned with the wrong aspects    `the messenger   the story of joan of arc  is an unlikely and unwelcome historical addition to the hollywood shelf    anyone searching for an entertaining epic is going to be painfully slapped with an overblown and confusing film    despite my original hopefulness   milla jovovich is not going to have to worry about thanking the academy    
44,48, the u   s   army utilizes a number of books known as field manuals which stipulate the specific way in which almost every action imaginable must be done    one particular field manual is known as the fm 22 5   which among other things   covers the practice of saluting    under the   saluting   section is a sub section which covers how a salute is rendered by a military work detail in the presence of a superior officer    the salute is rendered by the highest ranking individual present when the superior officer comes within six paces of the detail   and is dropped when the officer passes six paces from the detail    in any event   the salute is rendered only by the man   or woman   in charge   rather than by the whole group    almost at the very beginning of the general s daughter   we see a general s motorcade passing a work detail    everyone salutes    it looked impressive   but it just wasn t right    that little bit showed me that someone either didn t do the appropriate research   or made the conscious decision to go with style over substance for the scene    in fact   this would serve as a metaphor for the rest of the picture   as it seems director simon west tried so hard to craft a film with atmosphere and flash that he forgot a coherent story and good characterization are also crucial to a good movie    what results is a film that looks good   but like that one scene   just isn t right    the first fifteen minutes of the film is a good example    paul brenner   john travolta   is an agent for the army s criminal investigation division   undercover at a georgia army base to investigate an illegal arms sale    prior to the transaction   the buyer gets a whiff that brenner isn t the unscrupulous supply sergeant he s supposed to be   and later that night attempts to kill him by shooting up the houseboat on which brenner is living    so ensues a cat and mouse action sequence which ends like a certain scene in raiders of the lost ark   we ll just say that it involves propellers      brenner then receives new orders when the commanding general s daughter   captain elisabeth campbell   leslie stefanson     is found naked   bound   and dead on one of the base s training ranges    he is teamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill   madeleine stowe   to uncover the truth about the peculiarly gruesome murder    what i want to know is why the whole action scene with the arms buyer was even necessary    it gives no insight into brenner   other than the fact that he s a little cocky    does the arms subplot turn up later    no   so why add this extra running time to the film    the answer   it looked cool    or how about the   atmosphere      the beginning of the general s daughter presents us with imagery of the deep south   thick trees   dirt roads   sultry colors over water   all backed up with bayouesque music    nice immersion in the setting   but it soon doesn t matter   for when the film s plot shifts over to the murder investigation   so does the entire mood    no attention is paid to the location of the story   and the music is altered to fit a very generic thriller theme    did the filmmakers start out thinking they were making a different movie    instead of creating a cohesive atmospheric theme for the entire film   we get the distraction of one of theme followed by another   just because the director thought he should show off some of the countryside    the above examples also serve to illustrate that inconsistency is another problem with this movie    as i ve already mentioned   an entire section of the film doesn t jibe with the rest   and the characterization only adds to the difficulty    brenner   who comes across as a man with little respect for authority   suddenly snaps to in the presence of general campbell   james cromwell   and utters some of the corniest   yes   sir   s i ve ever heard    he even delivers an emotion charged monologue about why he will work so hard to catch the person who killed the general s daughter   even though he was totally flippant about the whole thing just a couple of minutes previous    sunhill   who initially comes across as a professional investigator   utilizes a couple of blatantly illegal methods to obtain information   and even revels in her ingenuity    both characters are protagonists   but it s hard to get behind them when their personalities are all over the place   and in some cases   simply unappealing    i could imagine that during filming   west would shoot a scene   then take the actors aside and tell them     let s do it again   but this time   i want more      i say this because although travolta and stowe are normally very good   in this film they overact in most of their scenes    an even worse offender is clarence williams iii as the general s aide   colonel fowler    i swear the guy says all of his lines from the position of attention    a far cry from his days as linc in   the mod squad     i can t help but think he was acting from west s direction    a couple of side characters including a west point psychologist   john beasly   and a young female private   ariyan a   johnson   make their scenes nearly impossible to bear    the only two actors who seem to have escaped west s influence are james woods   who provides a good performance as colonel moore   elisabeth s mentor at the psychological operations unit   and timothy hutton as colonel kent of the military police    woods relishes the role of a man whose job is playing with people s minds   and does so without ever taking it over the top    hutton just kind of hangs around   but at least he wasn t overacting    i haven t read the nelson demille novel on which this movie was based   but i ll bet more than a few dollars that the story was better in book form    the movie version has got characters which come and go with little or nothing to do except fill up space   or provide bits of information which seem to neither mean anything in terms of advancing the story nor reveal any significance once the whole story is finished    every time we re presented with some new aspect to the case   west gives us more of that flash by playing it up like it s the most momentous discovery ever   but the information is not used by the investigators at all    instead   when conclusions are drawn   they are such tremendous leaps of faith that you wonder if successful investigations are not based on facts   but lucky guesses instead    the army should have saved time by bringing in brennan and sunhill   letting them play a game of twenty questions with the suspects   then letting them guess who the killer was    would ve been over in a half hour    the film finishes with a sort of bookend   featuring the same style and southern scenery as the very beginning    literally during the closing credits   we get to see brennan get in his car and drive off   then we get to see sunhill get in her car and drive off    they both seem kind of happy    maybe they were driving away from simon west    
45,44, well arnold has completed the seemingly impossible task    he has made three consecutive unsatisfactory action films    in a domain that he owns   it is very surprising that this goliath of an action star can not tell a good action script from a bad one    eraser   back in 1996   was a confused film that made no attempt at all to make sense    batman and robin   in 1997   was the black sheep of the batman series with ridiculous acting   idiotic action scenes   and painfully flashy costumes    now in 1999     end of days     not   the end of days     is the third strike in a tough at bat for arnold    is this the end of a powerful action star s long lived career    will arnold ever give us another unforgettable performance in another unforgettable classic like those in the past     terminator       terminator 2   judgement day       predator        or an unforgettable performance in a great guilty pleasure like those in the past     commando       red sonja       true lies        it doesn t look that way       end of days   begins with the birth of a baby girl in 1979 who inexorably   due to the formation of the stars on that night   will be the carrier of satan s baby the hour before new year s of 2000    fortunately for the movie s sake   the girl grows up and now resides in manhattan with skyscrapers   subway trains in dark tunnels   and a myriad of inept nypd officers    it s an action film s dream come true when the director is given tons of cool stuff to blow up    imagine if the girl had lived in anytown   usa   where the only thing to destroy is a dairy queen and a post office    arnold schwarzenegger   jericho cane     in a series of boring events finds himself in the middle of a religious battle between the church   who is trying to hide the girl   or in some cases trying to kill her     and satan   gabriel byrne   who is trying to make her pregnant    if the devil is successful   the world will no longer exist as we know it    jericho feels it is his duty to protect the girl from everyone because 1   he once had faith but no longer does and 2   his wife and daughter were killed and he feels responsible for it    jericho cane is your cliched   by the numbers hero right up to his name    arnold fittingly plays the character as cliched as he can    he shouts at everyone   from cops to priests   to the devil    in one truly hilarious scene   which was supposed to be the ultimate dramatic high point   jericho screams to the devil     you are a @#$^% ! &  choir boy !  you are a choir boy !    those two lines marked the high points of this film    a movie can still be enjoyable when the supporting cast is more effective than the main actor       end of days   fails to contain any memorable performances with the exception of gabriel byrne    byrne   playing a man who has been made the manifestation of the devil   seems to be the only one who is having fun in this whole movie    he wonderfully plays a manipulative villain with the power to control everyone at any time    the annoying thing about his character   however   is that he has the power to kill any human with a simple punch in the face   yet he finds it impossible to seriously hurt jericho    i can not count the number of times he could have killed jericho and taken the girl from his custody    the other actors in the film give very weak and unconvincing performances    kevin pollak   who plays the partner and close friend of jericho   is the supposedly funny character in the film   every action movie has one      the one problem is that pollak does not deliver one funny line    robin tunney plays the chosen mother of satan s baby with extreme annoyance    she gets no sympathy from any of the characters in the film   except arnold who pretends she is his wife and daughter   or any of the viewers in the audience    in one unnecessary scene   tunney walks out of her room and takes her top off    is this her job in the film    the actors are not to blame entirely because the script is terrible    you can tell a script is terrible when you are able to predict what will happen minutes before it does    this little prediction game is a very fun exception to trying to sit through this nonsense of a movie    in a last attempt to make this movie good   special effects are used to try to entertain the audience    but without a memorable action scene in the whole film   the director has not done his job successfully    this film would have gotten a c+ if arnold stood in front of a camera and shouted   you are a ! $@^@ * ^  choir boy ! !    for two hours    
46,22, synopsis   original   jurassic park   survivor alan grant   neill   is tricked by paul and amanda kirby   macy and leoni   into leading an expedition to an island overrun by dinosaur   to rescue their stranded son    grant s team is picked off one by one as they encounter dinosaurs both new and familiar   and grant grows to realise that some breeds are more intelligent than he previously thought    review   there is one reason why   jurassic park iii   is better than its immediate predecessor     the lost world   jurassic park      the latter wasted 129 minutes of my life   the former   only 94    the first   park   was a marvellous film   full of awe inspiring sights   interesting characters   and genuine thrills    its two successors have been pale imitations   amounting to hundred million dollar b grade horror movies    at least this third entry realises it   whereas   the lost world   tried to justify its existence with a ludicrous and overextended plot     jurassic park iii   simply sticks its characters on an island with a bunch of dinosaurs and lets the mayhem begin    there is a desperate sense of deja vu presiding over this movie   the computer animated dinos are no longer novel or exciting   and even the first time presence of aerial lizards scarcely improves the situation    remember that wondrous first trolley ride through the park in the original movie    nothing in this rehash even comes close    add in execrable dialogue from screenwriters buchman   payne and taylor   and phoned in performances by the normally capable macy and leoni   and it is difficult to recommend the film to anyone but dino enthusiasts    at least neill makes some effort to retain the dignity of his character   and there is much less gore than in   the lost world     making this installment more suitable for children    
47,23, a fullyloaded entertainment review   website coming soon !  hunter s   thompson s fear and loathing in las vegas   written in 1971   is already an american classic   not merely because it was an unadulterated journey through the post psychedelia of the 1960 s   but also because it ushered in a new form of journalism known as   gonzo      soon after the book was written   hunter s   thomspon became the basis for a character in doonesbury known as uncle duke    and that is the problem with fear and loathing in las vegas   the movie      although the book is one of my favorites   i now agree with thompson s own assessment of the novel as   unfilmable      the main problem is that the book   although detailing wild drug use and tripped out adventures   was not written on the road    it was written and edited by hunter s   thomspons   relatively sober   at his home    so although the book depicts drug use and still more drug use   it is told with a sense of aloofness and some humor    hunter s   thomspon   the narrator   while always drugged out   still has a grip on reality   and can still tell   with journalistic ability   what is going on around him    not so with the characters in fear and loathing in las vegas    despite name changes and one minor scene from the book dropped   the movie is an exact duplicate of the book   in terms of dialouge    unfortunately   this can get annoying   in the form of johnny depp s   who plays thompson   excessive narration    and the characters   while having vivid personalities   are played as 2 d characers on the screen   dr   raoul duke   johnny depp   the name raoul duke was an alias of thompson s   and his riding companion   dr   gonzo   benicio del toro     who is a large samoan lawyer   have no personalities or emotions at all   save for stoned    the film is very faithful to the plot   what there is   of the book   in that dr   raoul duke is sent by sports illustrated to cover the mint 400   and takes along not only his samoan lawyer but also car trunk full of drugs    from there   one set of stoned adventures after another happens   including one of the few good scenes in which depp   high on acid   watches all the people in the bar around him turn into   literally   lounge lizards    while the movie has its moments   few     it is almost unwatchable at parts   especially towards the end    despite a lot of celebrity cameos   the stars never get off the ground    the set decoration and costumes are great   and probably deserve an oscar nomination    however   as we all know   it s not sets or effects that make a movie   its the characters   and quite frankly   these characters are no good    
48,42, some movies require you to turn off your brain in order to watch    then there are movies that require you to accept that everyone * in * the movie has turned off * their * brains    the real mccoy is both    it s charmless   molasses slow and so full of genuinely stupid people that the film commission of atlanta   where the real mccoy is set   might well consider some sort of ritual suicide for their complicity in this humiliation    the real mccoy opens with bank robber karen mccoy   kim basinger   being arrested in the middle of a job    six years later   karen is out on parole and looking to stay straight    she soon bumps into j   t   barker   val kilmer     a hapless would be thief who idolizes karen    j   t   also has ties to jack schmidt   terence stamp     the man who blew the whistle on karen six years earlier for refusing to work with him    schmidt   who is in cahoots with karen s sleazy parole officer   gailard sartain     again wants karen to help him stage a robbery    this time he has some leverage   karen s kidnapped son    just when she thought she was out   they keep pulling her back * in   *  contrivances and sloppy plotting fly off the screen so fast and furiously you have to duck to avoid being hit by them    leading the list is the jack schmidt character   who through unexplained but presumably foul mains is already extremely wealthy when our story begins    there is no reason given why he should need or want to get involved in another crime   let alone why he would actually participate in the break in    karen s initial encounter with j   t   during a botched convenience store hold up also strains the limits of credibility    it would have been simple enough to have them somehow entangled at that point   but instead they run into each other the next day because they re leaving their parole officers at exactly the same moment    small world   eh    then there s the convenient car trouble during an attempted escape   and pet tigers which   through the power of the laws of bad cinema   must inevitably confront someone who has blundered into their cage    however   the buffoon prize goes to the atlanta police   who come off like the keystone kops on a bad day    but the fun doesn t end there in the shambles of a script by william davies and william osborne    there is also the absence of a single   solitary interesting character    karen is earnest and single minded in her motherly devotion   but lacking any kind of edge which would make her a convincing criminal   and basinger is not a thespian adept at fleshing out flimsy material    schmidt is a flaccid villain   the parole officer is a complete blank   and karen s son and ex husband might as well be furniture    only kilmer s j   t   is remotely appealing   but his one potentially intriguing quality   his ineptitude   is never developed    in fact   kilmer disappears during the middle of the film   just when his admiration for karen could have made for an interesting sub plot    i might have been more forgiving if the pacing had been more appropriate to a caper comedy   but the real mccoy goes nowhere fast    various scenes of sneaking and skulking seem to take forever   and some end with no reason evident why they didn t end up on the cutting room floor    even the reasonably clever climactic break in falls victim to this syndrome   including a scene of one of the thieves drilling open a vault which lasts   i kid you not   four minutes    there is no tension in the scene   just tedium    russell mulcahy   highlander   is a director with some style   and indeed the real mccoy looks reasonably good   but he completely stumbles in the editing room    there are so many big problems with the real mccoy that i m tempted to overlook the little ones    like karen disarming one of schmidt s henchmen and throwing his gun into the middle of a park where her son is playing    like a fountain crushed when a van runs into it reappearing in one piece a few moments later    tempted   but i m pretty good at resisting temptation    
49,28, steve martin shines but sgt   bilko  fails to impress  based on the popular 50 s sitcom   sgt    bilko follows the string of old sitcoms to movie conversion fever    remember the brady bunch movie or the beverly hillbillies released sometime back       brady bunch was a moderate hit in in the us while hillbillies flopped      i do not really know whether the hollywood minds are running out of good ideas or just being plain lazy   but the tv conversion movies are hitting our screens like wildfire   sad to say   with mixed success    such movies are mostly targeted at us viewers since they are usually followings of such series over there and the larger the following   the more likely the sitcom will be made into a movie    sgt    bilko   frankly   i have not seen any its original tv version     even with the charm and wild antics of funnymen steve martin and dan akroyd   failed to entertain    sgt   ernest bilko is the man behind the motor pool   place of vehicle storage and repair   of fort baxter    though totally unskilled in the field of work that he is supposed to be in charge of   he has an almost superhuman ability and zeal to sniff out money making opportunities   from running a gambling den in the military garage to 4 d pools    though materialistic in mind   bilko s methods has thoughtfully `enriched  the lives of the men of fort baxter   providing them with some form of real recreation within the camp and the people love him for that    colonel hall runs the entire fort and thanks to his inborn `blissfully confused  state   bilko has managed to hide his operation   though nearly every living person in the fort knows about it    bilko s state of ascent is suddenly under fire when the pentagon sends major thorn   a tough cookie on army regulations   to check on the progress on the $70 million hovertank project   a new weapon under development within the fort s grounds    to add to his problems   thorn is determined to bring bilko down in retalliation of a major `sabo  done on him by bilko during their younger army days    director jonathan lynn   who directed my cousin vinny   in which marisa tomei won an oscar for best supporting actress   managed to pull sgt    bilko through with suitable pacing and some exceptional moments of laughter   but that is about it    there are really not enough laughter packed moments in sgt    bilko to fully entertain the average movie goer    still   steve martin s sgt    bilko is played with finesse and full force by the renowned comedian    without him   sgt    bilko would have just fell flat on its face    sgt    bilko did moderately well in the us box office early this year but i doubt it will earn much elsewhere around the world    the current trend in mixed successes in such tv conversions may be a blessing in disguise   really   at least it will force hollywood to re think any of its initial intentions to turn another tv idea into a movie or at the very least approach those ideas with more creativity    unless you are a fan of the tv series or love to watch steve martin in action   you can skip this one when deciding which movie to catch in the local theatres    i m sure there are better ones around    
50,35, as forgetful as some people may be it is doubtful that anyone could forget their wedding   especially three times    but   alas professor brainard somehow manages to accomplish this feat twice before the momentous night that he actually creates flubber    it s amazing that he is able to remember any of the processes he uses to make anything    the whole point here is how could a man be so blatantly forgetful    this is not absent minded this is almost mindless and he is a professor    well   this is the case for about the first half of the movie then things begin to settle into what might truly be considered absent minded    along the way to becoming absent minded from absent of mind the professor stumbles onto flubber    thankfully or there would be no movie or any amusement for the audience    the flubber is supposed to be flying rubber   but it seems to have a life of its own    this is there strictly for the kids    the properties of the flubber provide some antics for the audience when flubber coated golfballs and bowling balls assail two would be thugs    although amusing this is not original what so ever and brings back haunting memories of home alone    the poor professor has to save the university where he teaches at   get his fiancee back   finally stop the plotting of an evil millionaire   and do all this in the funniest way possible    admittedly there are funny moments but the movie is rather shallow and does not compare very well to the original   the absent minded professor      the whole scene with the basketball game was just atrocious and totally unbelievable    the basketball players   stereotypically unqualified for the sport   somehow manage to bounce   fly and dribble their way back to being close to winning    this just sounds too bad to be true   the least that could have been done was keep semi close to the original movie to give this film a chance    as for innovations and new ideas there is but two good ones in this movie    giving life to the flubber   which is so poorly executed that it s best forgotten   and prof   brainard s flying robot weebo    giving life to the flubber would have worked beautifully if it wasn t for scenes of the sort where you have the flubber dancing around on tables and books for no real reason other than to put in a bit of music and extend the length of the movie    the life of the flubber had brief and rather whimsical moments where it might have been used well   but it wasn t and in the end might have done the movie more harm than good    now   weebo is a totally different story    it s a robot that prof   brainard created but forgot how and gave something of a life too    this is a really original idea   well maybe not   but it is an idea that is well executed and in the end makes the poor robot the most developed and real character in the movie    yes folks the little yellow robot has more emotion and character than the characters    the film lacks the emotional punch to pull the audience in at all    the acting by robin williams   prof    brainard   seems to be half hearted for most of the movie and in many cases quite forced    most of the acting in the movie was so convincing as to fool only the part of the audience that had not quite yet reached the age to 12    people when stood up at the altar   don t usually give third chances    or for that matter talk to the fiancee afterwards   but what can be expected this is a children s movie    flubber   as a movie does little original and is nothing special in any respect    with the best character in the movie being something of a prop i doubt that many people will find it all that great    it does have its amusing moments and it is a good story in the end   but it does not wash up to the original    kids should find this movie amusing and fun and they ll probably enjoy the whole movie    as a movie it s just a kids movie and not the best of ones at that
